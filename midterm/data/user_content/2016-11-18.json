				"commentBody": "The economic side of our medical system is in shambles. Consumers are caught in the middle of an arms race between medical providers and insurers in which prices keep going up but in which insurers never pay the list price, only the uninsured and out-of-network do. There is normally a negotiated rate between insurer and provider which is considerably lower than the list price. If we dispensed with this and went to a truth in pricing system, we could make a dent in the problems identified in the article. I normally pay for my providers, as they are usually out of network, and I have never found the doctor's charges to be excessive or unreasonable. But I know in advance what the charge will be and am not charged unreasonably. If providers moved to a truth in pricing system, posting the cash rate, that would go a long way to solving this problem.",

There are many people in Madison who are conservative, and there have been many racists incidents on campus lately. So the actual story is quite nuanced. ",

One of my friends, who was uninsured at the time, was hospitalized for a rather expensive emergency surgery. He was hit with an astonishing bill which his brother went in and \"negotiated\" for him.

I was examined in the ER, then scheduled for an operation the next to repair the ankle with a plate and pins. The ER doc was out of network, the blood tests labs were out of network (it was split between 2 different ones!), and the anesthesiologist was out of network. By some stroke of luck, the orthopedic surgeon was a teaching fellow and my surgery day was one of the two days he came to that hospital. The out of network anesthesiologist charged more than the surgeon and the surgeon's fee included 6 follow-up office visits. And that's when we first heard those two dreaded words:  balance billing. They wanted another $1200 from us.  Their office said they weren't going to adjust the cost at al, and would report us to the credit agencies if we didn't pay in full. It is a medical carjacking. Out of the $40,000 total cost for a 2-day stay in the hospital and the operation ($10 for one multi-vitamin!), the balance billing, the deductible and the co-pays added up to $14,000. <br/><br/>That's when we realized the American medical system was even more broken than my ankle.

We do not have employer-paid plans for working people and privately paid plans for the rest of the population. We are all part of a tax funded system, and the hospitals are run by the government. - When absolutely the whole population is a part of the system then we do not have any kind of problem with \"pre existing conditions\" and we do not have any problem with younger people staying on the parents plan. Because everybody is covered for everything. The average cost per \"member\" of the system gets much lower when absolutely everybody is included automatically when they are born. And since everybody is covered for everything we do not have any insurance company in our plan. The government is the insurance company. Total average cost per \"member\" is about 50 percent of US cost and we have just as high quality treatment as US do. - You can never make \"Obamacare\" cheaper og better without using this common european model.",
