And here I was was finally meeting --- and interviewing --- my idol, David Bowie. Generous and gracious, and willing to help me with my new clean time. My most memorable on-air question for him was, \"Have you ever been fat?\" He thought it was funny, but decided to take it seriously, giving compliments to his wife Iman whom he said was a fantastic cook. One of my Halloween decorations was a battery-operated throbbing heart. It was lying on the studio furniture. While I wasn't looking, David, with this macabre device activated, stuffed it down his pants. He had to nudge me before I saw it. I laughed like a madman. ",

				"commentBody": "Hailing from a deeply conservative middle-class Mexican family, my first purchase of a Bowie album became the ultimate act of transgression. I was about 10 years old when I finally decided to set foot at the nearby shopping mall\u2019s record store, bent on buying a record with my meager savings. The first bars of \u2018Life On Mars?\u2019 caught my ear as soon as I entered the store\u2026 and they never let go. At that stage I could barely understand basic English, and was way too young to fully grasp the lyrics, but something about the song moved me to head straight for the DJ booth and meekly ask for the album. <br/><br/>When I proudly emerged from the store, with an empty velcro wallet in my pocket but an imported vinyl pressing of Hunky Dory held firmly between my grubby little hands, I felt the rush of having done something by myself, something grownups did on a regular basis. It felt good. My parents were horrified. My dad scolded me for wasting money on \u201cstupid rock music\u201d, my mom wanted to take me to church as soon as she found out that the curious-looking being on the album art was actually a dude. Thankfully the store had a strict \u201cno refunds policy\u201d, so my record was confiscated for a few days until I managed to get it back from its hiding place. In the end, David Bowie found a way to stay with me. I guess you can say he taught me more about English, music, tolerance, originality, uniqueness and independence than my parents ever could. ",

				"commentBody": "I think a lot of people are missing the point.  By making Harvard free, admissions would no longer be motivated to admit wealthier students.  The percentage of wealthy students in the class would fall, perhaps dramatically.  As it is now, the school uses a number of proxies to assure a large percentage of wealthy students - admitting legacies, admitting from prep schools and big cities, and so on.  No doubt the expectation of tuition from these folks is a huge motivator.<br/><br/>In addition, I think it's great that people are finally waking up to the fact that white males are not the only ones suffering from affirmative action.  In fact, Asians are probably the biggest losers from this policy and from the admissions of places like Harvard in general, which allot a certain number of spots for rich kids and a certain number of spots for minority kids and very few spots to middle-class non-minority over-achievers, who are disproportionately Asian.  I'd love to see some data on which race has lost the most due to affirmative action.",

AFTER being admitted, I did get a long letter listing numerous \"scholarships\" that apparently reflected bequests from dead alumni. Most of them offered, say, $100 if you happened to be descended from, say, a family with the surname of Ziffelschwartz from the central Pennsylvani town of Ziffelschwartzville. I didn't meet any of the requirements, and so I got nothing.<br/><br/>But I emphasize: That was AFTER admission, and so it had nothing to do with the admission decision. Possibly legacies counted for more in undergraduate admissions, though I doubt it was much different. And if legacies did matter back then, my impression is that they've mattered less and less over the past several decades.<br/><br/>This is not to say that discrimination against Asian-Americans isn't occurring -- only to suggest that, if that discrimination is occurring, \"legacies\" aren't the reason for that.",

They have insurance, which the office takes, and wanted to know from me if the doctors can legally demand cash upfront. The doctors offices said that lab tests are being routinely rejected by insurance companies so they demand cash upfront now!  I researched this and in fact many doctors are now demanding payment upfront even from those of us who are insured.<br/><br/>The wife who has breast cancer was in tears because they insurance premiums are deductibles are so high and already paid for the year, still she is being rejected for care.  <br/><br/>She said, she should have saved that $2K for her funeral so as not to burden her children.<br/><br/>I was speechless. So much defeat, sadness and honesty in her voice. <br/><br/>After she hung up, I just looked dazed at the GOP debate and wondered if any of these dangerous corporatists have met a real American family to know the current state of our country and our increasing desperate families.<br/><br/>I'm still numb with pain and sadness at the disconnect in this country between the haves and the have-nots. We worry about ISIS when our own domestic institutions are literally leaving people to die...people who work, pay their dues, and are playing by rules rigged in favor of insurance cartels.

My Medicare A and B doesn't cover dental care, even though I paid into social security for over 50 years. Root canal treatment costs a small fortune. I don't have the money to pay for it. Now I'm looking for someone who will extract one of my teeth for a reasonable price. I don't care if she/he is qualified. I just am tired of the constant pain. Members of the U.S. Congress get full dental coverage paid for by the American taxpayer - even after they are out of office and, get this, until they die. Is it any wonder that so many working people in the U.S. are so angry? Just wait until we go into the privacy of the voting booth on election night in November. We won't be worrying about being politically correct when we pull that lever.<br/> Lord help us because we sure need help.",

Frankly, I very seriously doubt that. I went to Harvard (Law) and certainly had no \"connections.\" More important, my three kids all went to elite private elementary and high schools, and even the suggestion that someone would use \"connections\" is considered highly inappropriate. Even more important, the prospect that anyone in the admissions department at an elite university would pay any attention to \"connections\" these days strikes me as highly unlikely. All I've ever heard is that admissions personnel are very strongly opposed to showing any favoritism on that basis, and that they are so zealous about that that anyone even THINKING about trying to exploit \"connections\" will very quickly recognize that any such effort is more likely to HURT than to help their child's chances.<br/><br/>We do have a friend who's on the Board of Trustees of an Ivy League School, and she has two sons attending that school (actually, one already graduated). That might seem to disprove my point above, but the fact is that both of those students would have been admitted to that school (and any other school they might have chosen) based entirely on their own merits.",

On the off chance that you get admitted and don't manage to figure out that gobs and gobs of financial aid are available at Harvard, maybe the $45,000 sticker price may dissuade you.

Articles appear frequently in the public press including the NYT telling them they won't do well at these schools because they won't fit in.  It's infuriating.     Students are constantly bombarded with articles that allege that some people should just accept reality and not even think about college.  Insidious and true.  It's a subtle and sometimes not so subtle reminder that some people just should remember their place.  We have marched backward in time and it's not pretty. ",

It's probably true that students with educationally-minded parents and/or who attend a high school with a proactive and informed guidance office do know about Harvard's financial aid package. However how many underrepresented students, both economically and racially, do you think actually have these advantages? I can tell you from personal experience as someone who has advised high school seniors that many students have no clue and have a great deal of difficulty navigating the complex process of college applications. Students of privilege often have an abundance of help in this area. To name just a few: SAT tutors, college advisers, strong in-school advising offices and highly involved parents. The student who can apply to and get into Harvard without this kind of assistance is rare... My son, who went to Williams, was advised by his guidance counselor to only apply to our local community college.",

Stigmatizing people with what, for many, is a mere chemical imbalance that is easily correctable makes no sense. Rather than avoiding him or her, I'd rather see a physician whose personal experience may very well make that person a more compassionate, more sensitive, and more considerate individual, particularly with respect to the millions of patients in this country who may, at some time or another of their lives, be faced with extreme life stresses or crises, not to mention hormone imbalances, having the potential to precipitate depression or some other mood disorder. <br/><br/>It sounds as if some of Dr. Carroll's colleagues need to get over themselves, by the way. The fact that patients, as lay persons with respect to their area of expertise, defer to their medical knowledge is by no means an indication that they are regarded as otherwise perfect or superior. Not everyone aspires to or is interested in medical school; in fact, some of my colleagues whose fathers were doctors told me that they had been specifically warned away from that line of work, and I know of several physicians whose grades and test scores were lower than those of my children (some of whom have doctorates, but are not medical doctors) when they were classmates at school. I do hope these younger doctors bring a more enlightened attitude to work.",

Syria is the size of the State of Washington.  And the Russians are now in Syria in force as are the Iranians.  100,000 troops?  Maybe.  Or maybe 250,000.  And the likelihood of starting a major conflagration with disastrous consequences.  And what other country is willing to put boots on the ground to support such an invasion?  I have heard absolutely no one articulate specifically how Obama is supposed to solve this situation, but, like Kristoff, they're eager to blame him for not fixing it.
