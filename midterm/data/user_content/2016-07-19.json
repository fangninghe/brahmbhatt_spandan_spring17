				"commentBody": "\u201cI blame Hillary Clinton personally for the death of my son\"<br/><br/>To use the anguish of a mother who has lost her son to further Mr Trump's ravenous political ambitions is about as low as you can get.  How many times could you multiply that anguish by all the mothers who lost their sons in a cooked up Iraq war by the Republican Bush/Cheney administration.   The Republicans really know how to dishonorably wear the flag by providing the country with chickenhawks at or near the top of their ticket such as Bush, Cheney, and Trump.  Trump is the biggest smear artist to ever run for the modern day Presidency.  There are no boundaries for this guy.  The other day he implied our President was a bigot towards white police officers.  The people who give a full throated roar of approval for Trump's tactics should send the chills down the spines of all thinking Americans.  ",

Tonight we had Sean from The Real World Boston - who is apparently an actual Congressman and married to Rachel from The Real World San Francisco? How did this happen, America? - and they're on stage at the RNC convention making Hillary Clinton jokes? <br/><br/>I'm not sure a national political convention is the right place for these folks. I think Mr. Trump is secretly halfway embarrassed by this lineup - all of them, not just the reality people. Not because of what they're saying (which is relentlessly tasteless), but because they're not the A-list he loves. I know Scott Baio was on the TV show Happy Days but I know him from his reality show on VH1. He was a bit off then, too. And were any of these speakers - not just the reality ones - well-versed on issues other than hate and bitterness? It appears not.<br/><br/>So what other people is Mr. Trump going to push up there? Omarosa? I see today she has been made his director of African-American \"outreach\". Yep, that's gonna work! The longer this campaign goes on it seems more and more like a remake season of \"Punk'd\". Is Ashton Kutcher in Cleveland filming this? It wouldn't surprise me one bit.",
