				"commentBody": "Wheel of Suffering:  Thank you for that long explanation.<br/><br/>You are mistaken about the interpretation of laws in physical science.  No physicist believes most of the known laws don't have intrinsic reality.  Quantum mechanics is the only important partial exception.<br/><br/>There is a large difference between laws and assumptions.  Laws can be tested and modified or discarded.  Assumptions can be, but are less likely to be.  I think this difference is extreme in social science.  Here we tend to agree.  Assumptions like people being rational, self interested actors are pretty weak and a theory based on them doesn't actually work.  But in economics the political side is too dominant to let that discredit such theories, except to a few mavericks.",

				"commentBody": "Juliet,<br/>The Japanese and the Koreans have a much more complex relationship than your one dimensional analysis of the situation would imply. We don't need the comfort women issue to have an anti japanese card. We have the japanese invasions of the 1600's, the mass kidnappings of artisans, pillaging of villages, the assassination of our queen, colonization, starvation, torture of our citizens, the killings of our grandparents snd great grandparents, including mine. This not just a logical treaty to be signed. Abe has on various occassions denied official government involvement of comfort women as well as their wrong doings of the past. It is not just a sum of money being sought but \"\uc0ac\uc8c4\" to the victims. A deep, heartfelt apology. Koreans were victims of Japanese empire building and American foreign policy decisions from the Theodore Roosevelt era on. The Japanese used the pseudo science phrenology to convince Americans that Koreans needed to be annexed, the same way white Anericans used it to justify slavery and racism towards blacks. America has been a silent force driving the atrocities in Korea from the late 19th and 20th centuries. Also, Vietnam was NOT a war Korea participated in willing. We were under a dictatorship and the current president's father, the former President Park gave in to the American request for aid in Vietnam. Koreans were there in a supporting role. I don't think incidents of rape amounted to 300,000 women in a systematic method during the Vietnam War.",

				"commentBody": "There are still those that deny the holocaust happened and will use any means necessary to eradicate that atrocity from the history books. It is due to the Israeli efforts and the efforts of their allies that the truth has been kept alive. Korea's pain from the Japanese occupation, including comfort women, forced conscriptions, tortures, starvation, and other cruelties live in the national memory of its people, yet the perpetrators were barely punished because the u.s. deemed it a necessary foriegn policy at the time. And lets not forget, it was Theodore Roosevelt who brokered the deal that handed Korea over to the Japanese. The 19th and 20th centuries of Korean history were a tragic time for its people and the pain is deeply embedded in personal memories of families and individuals who still carry the past with the. Is it so wrong that they want the long overdue acknowledement and recoginition?",

That's being a bit naive, this isn't the 19th century.  Grenada Chocolate Company, a company i mentioned in an earlier posting, started from scratch here in the U.S.   I was friends with 2 of the 3 founders, late founders to be more specific.  They hand built most of the machines but had to buy other equipment from Belgium to adequately refine the chocolate.  If you have the money or credit, you can do it.

				"commentBody": "The Chinese are far more astute than most of the Republican candidates scrambling for the nomination.<br/><br/>They are aware that most of the 16 Republican candidates for president do not hope to be the nominee of their party, much less president of the nation.<br/><br/>Most just want to extend their shelf life on the rubber chicken circuit of book tours and right wing speaking engagements, or perhaps another talking head show on Fox.<br/><br/>A serious analysis of the purple state demographics that will largely determine the outcome of the election would not cause the Chinese to pay any significant attention to the big mouths of the Republican party.",
