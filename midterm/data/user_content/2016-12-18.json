				"commentBody": "Seriously, when has a Presidential candidate been fact-constrained?<br/><br/>I'm not sure Paul Krugman has paid attention to the facts of the election.  Many Trump voters voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012.  Why the shift?  Other Obama voters simply didn't vote.  Why?  Trump's victory came from close elections in essential swing states; Clinton won the popular vote by more than 2,000,000.  Did computer voting systems with no paper trail effect the outcome?  (Did the computers record the correct vote?  How would one check?)<br/><br/>What about the difference between Candidate Obama and President Obama?  Candidate Obama promised transparency.  President Obama demonstrated serious opaqueness, attacking whistle-blowers more than anyone.<br/><br/>Six or so years ago, there were no \"shovel-ready projects\" for infrastructure repair.  How did President Obama rectify that claim in the meantime?<br/><br/>Finally, Krugman seems to have blinders on with Clinton's own serious corruption -- as well as her militarism.  She supported \"humanitarian bombing\".  Honduras's military takeover wasn't, while Venezuela posed a serious western-hemispheric security risk.  Clinton gave speeches for millions of dollars to Goldman and other too-big-to-fail banks.  How many of their high officials got prosecuted -- even for large-scale drug-money laundering?<br/><br/>What was Clinton's real position on TPP?  What did Clinton tell us about its contents?  Who knows what is in TPP?",

				"commentBody": "\"I don\u2019t think any kind of economic analysis can explain this\" is pretty inane when one considers that globalization is largely about moving goods-producing work that require semi-skilled or even skilled blue collar labor to countries where labor is cheap.  That necessarily leads to structural unemployment if no mitigating action is taken.  Krugman himself pointed out in his \"Notes on the macroeconomic situation\" that we were at nearly full employment with low labor force participation--a good indicator that some have found themselves unemployable.  In another response, Schrodinger points out that a quick perusal of state employment data bears this out.  The industrial revolution did not eliminate agriculture, although agricultural jobs continue to decline; the computer revolution will not eliminate industry, although it does bring automation.  Eventually cheap labor will be replaced by automation, and other jobs will be created to take advantage of the resulting industrial capabilities.  Why is the US not leading the way?  Outsourcing manufacturing gives away that job creation capability.",

What makes this situation different, is that the dirty trick in question distorted nothing and propagated nothing that wasnt actually the case. I see it as a very minor and relatively innocuous version of the Pentagon Papers -- or the revelations of Snowden. Whats suspicious is not the so-called hacking, but the extraordinary effort on the part of Democrats to use this as a policy tool, almost as though it was another Gulf of Tonkin incident.
