				"commentBody": "Ugh planning food for kids is one of the top 5 worst things about being a parent. When I had my kids I promised myself they would eat a balanced, nutritious diet and would not be picky eaters.  We don't add sugar to anything, only purchase whole, unprocessed foods, and my favorite foods in the world are vegetables. And yet here I was two days ago -- we met a friend for a picnic with delicious Iranian foods such as yogurt dip, a bean and pasta soup, cucumbers, tomatoes -- and my older son only ate the pita. The creeping accommodations to picky eaters, the fact that my husband cooks 3 of the dinners each week and rarely prepares a veggie side, combined with the fact that veggies take more time to prepare, have meant that 5 days out of 7, we don't even have a vegetable at the dinner table. The demoralizing feeling of making a nutritious lunch and having it come back completely eaten, or the fact that you can see your son's ribs -- these all skew you towards making the child favorites. It's not a deliberate decision -- it's just that there are about 30 food choices every week, and if you take the easy route a few times, it adds up and pretty soon you realize about 80 percent of your kid's diet is white flour.

They held the House and Senate from 2006, losing control of the House in 2010 and losing control of the Senate in 2014.<br/><br/>As for your contention that the \"repubs have been ruling by the do-nothing \u201cwe\u2019ll do anything to stop Obama and the Democrats\u201d, it appears that you are confused by the purpose of each branch...<br/><br/>The Legislature (House of Representatives and Senate) writes the laws - and ONLY the Legislature.  The President is charged with ENFOCEMENT of the laws.  <br/><br/>To clarify, the President does not make law, Congress does.  The purpose of an \"Executive Order\" is to give instruction to departments under Presidential control - the various Cabinets.  They are used to clarify rules from the boss and to authorize the details of the laws being enforced.<br/><br/>What an Executive Order is NOT - they are not intended, nor authorized, to create law or make rulings in contradiction to existing law.

Therefore your conclusion is invalid.  You will need far more data than this.<br/><br/>As for this particular point, the author (or you) has failed to prove that it is based on White Privilege.  <br/><br/>The right to vote is controlled at the State level, not the Federal level.  Therefore, you will need to investigate 50 different systems and sets of laws to reach any sort of valid conclusion.<br/><br/>Concerning Virginia and this case, you are again incorrect.  \"White Privilege\" would mean that there is a voting privilege given to \"Whites\" that is not also given to \"Other than Whites\" or is biased in such a manner as to give advantage to \"Whites\".  The Virginia Constitution of 1830, Article III, Section 14 states that \"Every white male citizen...\" shall vote except (among other criteria) those convicted of \"infamous crimes\".  This prohibition predates the Civil War and cannot be construed as targeting minorities, since the only valid voters were \"white male citizens\".<br/><br/>The criteria was intended to target \"voters\" and nothing more.

				"commentBody": "Who says that a gun was recovered at the scene?  A still photo that shows a gun?  Eye witnesses say they didn't see a gun.  How do we know that Mr. Scott didn't throw down the gun before he was shot?  The police chief said that the video does not show Mr. Scott pointing a gun.  What gun?  Have ballistics found anything?  Has the coroner located the bullet(s)?  Has the bullet been matched to a particular officer's gun - presumably the shooter.  <br/><br/>Someone posted earlier that the Charlotte Observer gave a long police record of Mr. Scott.  Look for yourself - that has been removed from their website.  I searched and found the \"Inquisitir\" (whatever that is) showing a record and now as of 10:30 pm CST that article has been removed.  I wondered when the rumors would start - the \"blame the victim\" lies that we always see.",

				"commentBody": "America is becoming a police state where citizens must obey 'commands' or be shot to death by 'peace officers' that shoot first and let the victims bleed out while they watch. Police are not part of the community, but a community unto themselves. Some are willing to just murder and play with the evidence. Others keep silent and protect the guilty because they are fellow officers.<br/>Murder without justice just sponsors revenge and chaos. Police officers in many cities have lost their mission to preserve and protect life other than theirs.",

Chief Putney is clearly against the intent, therefor, must be hiding the truth. I'm sure if the videos implicated Mr. Scott, the police would have hurried off the videos to their in-the-pocket Television stations for public broadcast. Isn't that what they usually do?",
