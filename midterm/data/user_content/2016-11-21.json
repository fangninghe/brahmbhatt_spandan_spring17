				"commentBody": "This is absurd. Is the NYT setting its readers up for a shift towards pleasing Trump and his administration? The NYT did not even vet Trump. It ignored the corruption of his foundation and stayed away from reporting in earnest his tangled business dealings and numerous lawsuits that pose more of an ethical threat than the Clinton Foundation ever could have. But only now is Donald being vetted somewhat but after the fact. We heard more about emails than anything else. And that did as much to suppress Clinton's vote as did Comey and the Russians.  I hear a lot of Trump voters who claim that America has become too soft, too much PC and that they are sick of hearing about safe spaces. So why then are they complaining the loudest when Trump Is bashed and criticized? Not all Trump voters are racist BUT all Trump voters knew that he is. So please, NYT, spare me your coddling of the Trump voter. That's not your job.",

				"commentBody": "There was bias in the election coverage, but it primarily was seen in the negative coverage of Clinton.  Whining is the respite of bullies like Trump, and his supporters.  The media distorted its depiction of Clinton's e-mail scandal (sic) in order to keep what looked like a blowout election as close as possible.  Its motive was not political, it was financial.  Keep the race going and the revenues flowing.  That the Times is publishing Spayd's fatuous lament is a case in point of the media's bending over backwards to appear impartial, even when journalistic ethics demand truth before balance.  I recall a front page piece on Ivanka and Donald Trump unveiling their plan for childcare assistance.  They openly lied-- yes lied-- about Clinton's not having a plan and never having even thought of helping working families needing childcare.  The NYT reporting this as \"stretching the truth,\" a phrase that implies there was some truth being stretched.  There was no truth at all to the Trumps' overt and bald faced lies.  There are legion examples of the press doing this.  I'd be happy to discuss this with the Capwells, who shouldn't be exculpated for electing an entirely unqualified and incapable bigot to the presidency.  I have a message for the Capwells and the North Carolina daughters of the confederacy who claim not to be racist, homophobic bigots.  You are bigots, and your support of bigots isn't justifiable, and if you'd like to talk more about that, bring it on.",

Just give it to me straight NYTimes. I don't need the click bait titles to your articles. I don't need your liberal ra-ra. I just want to understand both sides. I know that many other news outlets didn't get the election coverage right either. However, I pay monthly for the NYTimes. I can already see that things are not changing here so I am preparing to look elsewhere for my news. To Trump's delight no less.",

				"commentBody": "I very much appreciate the Public Editor column, the Opinion page, and The New York Times news reporting. There are two things that concern me every day when I read the online version: click-bait headlines, and the constant stream of unnecessary photos of the President-elect. The click-bait headlines I don't need to elaborate on; they are obvious and those who write them know it. Regarding the photos, it is a fact that many of us clinch up inside at a mere glimpse, and who doesn't know what he looks like? The image is regularly in our nightmares, and every additional image intensifies our anxiety level. Each article does not need a photo. How about longer, more informative headlines in place of photos of scary old white men? It does seem that sometimes The NY Times tries too hard to put forth right-wing perspectives rather than hard news. I do favor human rights, clean air and water, and education, and hope to continue to read reporting in depth on those things.",
