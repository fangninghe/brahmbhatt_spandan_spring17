(The latter would have to be done completely behind closed doors.) Does he really believe that Americans would elect someone who would be 78 years old after only one term?<br/><br/>I don't believe Sanders really has the welfare of the American people completely at heart. He's not pure as the driven snow, and I believe there's a massive amount of ego involved (similar to Trump, perhaps?).<br/><br/>If Sanders really wanted to change America he would have done it by now.  He could still achieve a great deal by leading his \"revolution\" from outside government, as did the great Gandhi and Martin Luther King.<br/><br/>Something stinks here, and Sanders is looking less and less attractive all the time. <br/><br/>I can barely stand to hear his voice anymore.",

				"commentBody": "Forget the repeated claims Bernie shouts or offers pie in the sky or that Hillary is strident or she's tough, seasoned, the most qualified person ever to run for president.  This isn't what matters. Bernie's not calling her unqualified because he's a misogynist and hates women - that's ridiculous and false.<br/><br/>Bernie's called her unqualified because of her very bad decisions on the Iraq War vote and regime change in iraq, the two most significant destabilizing foreign policy disasters in recent history. Decisions which resulted in political chaos and the rise of terrorist states in the middle east, endangering Europe, North Africa and the United States. Decisions which led to the loss of American lives - the lives of our troops, our allies, &amp; tens of thousands of innocent civilians. <br/><br/>Hillary made these decisions about the Iraq War (which was a no-brainer to anyone paying attention!) and regime change in Libya after being presented with facts and careful consideration. These weren't dumb remarks she made on the campaign trail while exhausted.  These decisions are the most important things she's running on - that she's the person we should trust to answer that 3 a.m. phone call that there's a crisis somewhere in the world that the U.S. president must respond to.  And her record shows that in these 2 most important situations in recent times, while she held important office as senator or in the cabinet, she made terrible, destructive choices that had tragic, ongoing consequences.",

				"commentBody": "From suggesting Sanders is not qualified to saying that he didn't 'prioritize' women's rights in abortion to exploiting the Flint water crisis and the tragedy at Sandy Hook, I am appalled at Clinton's tactics. On the surface, these moves almost seems too greasy and too corrupt to be from her campaign, but yet she continues to smear her opponent rather than talk about the issues that make many Americans wary of voting for her. <br/><br/>What did she say to Wall Street that they gave her so much money? Why is she still holding fundraisers with special interest groups and the rich when Americans detest campaign finance? Until Clinton can muster the courage and integrity to address these issues with at least some authenticity rather than condescension and rhetoric, many Americans will see her as an extension of the rich and the establishment. <br/><br/>If Clinton comes out and says \"This is how the system is, and that is why I am forced to fund raise in this way. I am sorry. From this day on, I will no longer accept money from X, Y, and Z.\" This is authenticity and a fearlessness needed in our next president, and I doubt Clinton or her campaign advisers would agree to do such a thing that would require character and insight. Instead, they will double down on their smear campaign and detract from her weakness as a candidate.<br/><br/>That is why I hope Bernie Sanders continues on with his integrity and his passionate anger. I will continue to give and give to his campaign because we deserve better.",

				"commentBody": "While I respect your views on Secretary Clinton, I find it horrifying and offensive that you'd suggest Sanders' supporters are falling for Republican rhetoric. I have never voted for a Republican in my life, I find the current GOP rhetoric horrifying, and I don't watch FOX and co., nor do I read any right-wing media. I find Hillary untrustworthy because she claims to be for campaign finance reform while engaging in and benefitting immensely from the Citizens United decision. I find her untrustworthy because she claims to be for tougher regulation of Wall St. while holding fundraisers and having given $225K speeches to their elite. I could go on.<br/><br/>While I don't doubt that she is a hundred times better than any of the Republicans running today and I'll vote for her easily in November, Bernie is raising issues that resonate with millions of Democrats, and while he trails her significantly in delegates, many of us have and will continue to vote for him until June because we believe in his message and his integrity. Don't try to sweep these valid criticisms of her under the rug by claiming that they're manufactured by Republicans.<br/><br/>I have always voted Dem because I agreed far more with their stances on the issues, but I've always identified as an Independent. I even changed my party affiliation to vote for Sanders this month. It's a sad day when Democrats try to discount Sanders supporters by claiming they naively believe right-wing rhetoric.",

But the strains of  campaigning and the long overdue vetting have revealed him to be exactly like any other politician, but maybe worse, because he is wrapped in so much sanctimony. It must be incredible to finally find oneself a rock star at 74, and I am sure these are the best moments of his life, but he is seriously in over his head. For the first time last night I donated to Hillary\u2019s campaign and I have noticed a similar subsiding of enthusiasm all over the internet.",

Hillary has a resume of many years in the political business that would be impressive if time spent at something is all that matters. What she lacks is good judgement and integrity. Bernie is saying that she disqualifies herself by all the bad decisions she made such as supporting the Iraq war, promoted the Lybian war, wants to go to war with Syria, supported all those destructive trade deals, accepting millions of dollars from firms that could benefit from her decisions and so on.

				"commentBody": "What are the qualifications for the presidency? One has to be at least 35, a natural born citizen of the US, and have resided within the US for 14 years. So by those criteria, both Hillary and Bernie are qualified. But of course what both are talking about is whether the other has the mettle to become a good president. Hillary points to her resume, as thought heaping one more accomplishment, one more activity polishes her credentials for the office. But we all know people whose resumes are replete with exceptional experience but whose judgment, whose moral fiber is wanting. And this is what Bernie and so many of us are saying. We keep returning to the Iraq resolution, because even though 2003 was a trying time when many of her constituents were afraid and wanted to strike out in retaliation, as Senator, her job was not to vote for the politically expedient thing, but to show leadership and do the right thing. Her hawkish positions as Secretary of State show that she hadn't learned that lesson, and her actions since 2012 -- the email server, her decision to sell herself to the highest bidders on Wall Street, her late criticism of Keystone and TPP -- all speak to serious lapses in judgment. I prefer a president whose ethics and trustworthiness are above reproach, because the rest of the job can be learned; trust and character are nurtured from childhood.",

Yes, it was! A costly one that we have not stopped paying for yet. She is a Hawk, not a smart power advocate. It's her \"smarter than thou\" attitude that gets in her way all of the time. She'd take this nation to war just to prove that she could. She's driven. Driven to become President no matter what it takes.

Her air of entitlement disqualifies her. <br/><br/>Anyone, Trump as a prime example, who after 15 years has not succeeded to the Presidency (both he and Clinton have desired the role for many years) does not mean there is a swell for them to do so now.

He served as the governor of Texas -- one of the weakest governorships in the country -- and he was AWOL from his pathetic position in the Texas Air National Guard -- but if Al Gore had said flat out that \"George Bush is unqualified to be president\" the media and the GOP would have gone into maniac mode attacking Gore and tearing him to shreds for even whispering it let alone saying it loudly in an interview.   It's definitely a dog-whistle from Sanders.<br/>I wouldn't vote of Sanders just for the fact that he sat on his axx in the Senate for years until he was 74 before he decided to do any of the heavy lifting to put himself in the forefront of American politics -- meanwhile people like Hillary Clinton has been in the thick of it for years -- many times being attacked not for anything she did but because people were angry with her husband for personal failures on his part.   Clinton stood up to all of it and she's running again -- even after suffering a defeat in 2008 that no one thought was possible.  That's a strong woman of conviction that she has something to bring to the table as President -- I'll vote for Hillary Clinton -- not the old guy who hid in the Senate for many years and only emerged when he was 74 -- a time when he should be retiring not looking for a new job.",

If Trump does the same when his party tries to shut him out at the convention, Bernie will win the general election and we might actually have a shot at ending the two-party system that has utterly failed the People for the last three decades.

They should both be competing in the who-can-beat-Cruz/Trump-the-best, not each other. I like both Sanders and Clinton, but he just lost my support.",

As someone born and raised in New York, I see that this race for the nomination will be decided this month, and New Yorkers and other in the Northeast watershed states need to take real and sudden notice of how HRC's judgement and decision making is severely lacking, and always has been. All the experience in the world does not necessarily result in good judgement, and qualifications on a resume' are simply not the same as qualifications of character.",
