But their relationship is mutually beneficial, sort of like a relationship found in nature between a parasite and its host.

Pleeaaze!  <br/><br/>Selig had NO real accomplishments in baseball and presided over the Billionaire Boys Club of owners running totally amok and trashing what was left of baseball as Head Owner.  And he was part of the owners' coup d'etat, deposing the last non-toady commissioner and then claiming \"I'm not really the Commissioner of Baseball\" before Congress!  I don't think so...<br/><br/>And as for Steinbrenner, it's hard to know where to start... Banned from baseball (for paying a known gambler to dig up dirt on HIS OWN star player, Dave Winfield!)... A felon, who pleaded guilty to making illegal contributions to Nixon's re-election campaign, and obstruction of justice, and was banned from baseball for two years...  Perhaps if the Hall has a \"Men of Infamy and Disgrace\" wing?<br/><br/>And as for Steinbrenner as a \"loyal friend,\u201d why not ask Dave Winfield, or Reggie Jackson, who are in the Hall, about Steinbrenner's \"loyalty\" and \"friendship\"?<br/><br/>Photo",

From the New Yorker summary (middle paragraph 2 below):<br/><br/>\"a series of thoughtful and energetic proposals that present precisely the kind of remedies that could improve the lives of many working-class and poor Americans of all races. She would simplify the tax code for small businesses and streamline their licensing requirements. ....<br/><br/>\"Clinton\u2019s tax plans are also designed to promote broader-based affluence. She would increase the tax rate on short-term capital gains for high earners, with lower rates for longer-term holdings; close the \u201ccarried-interest\u201d tax loophole that favors hedge-fund managers; and levy fees on banks with high debt levels. She would impose a four-per-cent surcharge on incomes above five million dollars a year, and adopt a minimum thirty-per-cent tax rate on incomes above a million dollars a year. She supports an \u201cexit tax\u201d and other fiscal adjustments that would discourage so-called corporate inversion\u2014the offshoring of companies to tax havens like Ireland. And she proposes tax incentives for investing in towns that have faced significant losses in manufacturing jobs. To address the compounding effects of trade and technology on displaced workers, she would promote training, and include a tax credit for businesses that take on apprentices. She would allocate $275 billion over five years to infrastructure improvement, focussing on transit and water systems ...\"",

They have attacked and expelled the victims of sexual assault to protect their sports teams. However, most universities do not invoke God in their rules of behavior. Both Baylor and Liberty have honor code based on their interpretation of the bible, just as BYU attacks the victims of rape as having violated the honor code. It is fair to attack religious based university as being especially hypocritical. The other universities are bad actors but they don't pretend to invoke God's laws.",
