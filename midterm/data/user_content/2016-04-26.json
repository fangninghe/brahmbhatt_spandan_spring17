She is bold here in ways she has not been before.<br/><br/>Watching this, I cried. I dropped jaw at the raw honesty displayed. And, I was moved by the possibilities of healing despite the rage.

Killing him is a huge curveball and that can't be underappreciated.<br/><br/>That said, I think the books and the show are now going to tell two very different stories, and that this season is the major point of departure. It would completely unseat all fan theories and expectations if they actually killed Jon, and that is very much in the style of the show. I'm saying that BECAUSE the writers and GRRM know that everyone wants (knows?) Jon is coming back, they might have written that narrative completely out of the season to surprise us.<br/><br/>So what if Jon is actually dead?",

				"commentBody": "Either the objective for the tax is revenue or the objective is behavioral change (or both).<br/><br/>It's fair to criticize the tax on revenue grounds because it's regressive. Krugman suggests that we should see the tax-as-revenue issue as linked with the policy that it funds. But I don't see why that's the case. Pre-K in Philadelphia could be funded a lot of different ways. Some of those ways are less regressive than a soda tax. So it seems like the regressivity of the tax understood as a way to pay for something is a separate issue from the progressivity of what it's supposed to pay for.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what to think of the tax as a way to change behavior. Normally, we don't think that restricting someone's option set, either by raising the cost of some options or by preventing them outright, is justified if it's done solely on the basis of the good of the person being so restricted. It seems like rational people ought to be able to decide what's in their own good; it's not clear why the state should take money from them up to the point that the better angels of their natures kick in. But then the issue is more complicated because it involves family purchases that may affect children. I'm not sure if that's a sufficient justification for a paternalistic tax or not. Probably, it's not something easy to work out without looking at numbers: how much benefit are we likely to receive and what are the burdens it will place on people who pay the tax?",

This is the ACLU's idea; they sued to dismantle the organized mental health system.  Now, you cannot force a mentally ill person to undergo treatment or take medication, use a shelter or stop harassing the public.  ",

I'd say that this piece was revived because it seemed like a fun thing to do, with a star that would give it new life (i.e. \"revival\").  The script was updated and JTF's performance is pretty amazing.  Let's keep in mind that the $147 price noted in this strange review is the top dollar price -- you can come and see it for 1/3 of that if you like, and having sat in the cheap seats myself I can say that it was a perfectly wonderful evening in the theatre.
