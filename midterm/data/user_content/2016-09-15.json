				"commentBody": "&gt; \"As a graduate of a poor NYC public school, I can say with certainty that there's no greater detriment to learning than the environment in these schools, the anti-intellectual, anti-good behavior, peer-pressure every student feels. Changing this is far more important than more money, smaller classrooms and better teachers. And the only way to change that environment is to get all the 'bad' apples out of the schools, so the kids who want to learn can learn and so teachers can teach. <br/><br/>There's a simple solution. What we need is to split public schools in to two types : those with kids who are willing to do their work, be respectful and behave and those with all the kids who make it hard for the others\"<br/>*  *  *  *  *  *  *<br/><br/>BEST COMMENT ON THIS TOPIC out here, and I have read them all ! ! !",

				"commentBody": "As an African-American woman with two daughters in college and who attended middle school in Harlem prior to receiving an academic scholarship to attend a private boarding school in New England, I need to make two comments:<br/><br/>1)  Black people need to be honest and talk about how education is not respected in poor black families.  It's no longer a \"way out\".  I grew up hearing that my grandparents in the South had to walk five miles to school each way!  When I was in middle school in Harlem, the kids said I talked \"white\" and tried to shame me because I did my homework.  Eventually, I was put in a class with students who were at the top the class and it was great.<br/><br/>2)  I accompanied my nephew on a field trip to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The school is on Lenox Ave, which is East Flatbush, but is now called Prospect-Lefferts Gardens because white people have moved into the neighborhood.  The teachers were white and from Marine Park.  One comment about the kids misbehaving went this way, \"My kids go to school in Marine Park\".  <br/><br/>The teachers had no lesson plan for these kids while they were touring the gardens.  The trip was an excuse to let them run wild with little supervision.  I took the time to ask each misbehaving child their name, what they wanted to be when they grew up and did they recognize any of the plants, trees or flowers in the gardens.  Before long, they were quiet, inquisitive and holding my hands.<br/><br/>These kids act out in an effort to get attention and guidance.",

If you investigate why that is so, you will have your answer.

Education is a wholistic endeavor. Unless you control the externalities our children face, you won't educate them well. And that will take more than changing teachers and schools.",

				"commentBody": "I was in graduate school in the early to mid 1970s. Papers akin to this essay with similar prescriptions were written back then. It is evident there are no easy fixes here.<br/><br/>Little has changed because idealistic ivory tower ideas seldom work in the real world, although authors like this one often form a mutual admiration society telling one another how great their latest proposed \"innovation\" is. <br/><br/>The most important factors in student success are stable homes and supportive parents who set high standards regarding what is expected in school and in life. Families don't have to be middle class to meet such standards, but that helps obviously. Poor immigrant children often have the bar set high at home and they meet it.<br/><br/>Basic integrity, being responsible and hard work are the norms conveyed. They expect the students to attend class, do their assignments and get good grades.<br/><br/>The fact schools and teachers can't fix broken homes, poverty, parents that don't value education and so forth...doesn't mean they don't care. But you can't ask the impossible of schools in my view, yet this professor and many other \"experts\" apparently continue to think you can. <br/><br/>But after 40-50 years of trying to help with free meals, supplies, tutoring, counseling and so forth, nothing much has changed. Fixing families and individual choices are the root issue. And schools and taxpayers can't fix those things. Most teachers really do care by the way, they are not the problem.",

Though 12th graders had passed state-mandated math, reading and writing tests through 10th grade, the preponderance of them read at or below 6th grade level. The unusual student could write complete sentences. As a result of their family and social backgrounds and current living conditions, most of these students struggled. Administration leaned hard on teachers to maintain \"failure\" rates of 10% or lower; otherwise, teachers risked non-renewal of contracts or reduction in pay. Administration-imposed teacher evaluations could be skewed by evaluators; 15% of a teacher's evaluation was based on student surveys; 35% was based on student performance on administration-prepared tests in which teacher input was minimal. Teacher resignations and retirements have run between 25% and 35% in this high school and 16 others with similar student bodies. ",

							"commentBody": "You raise a good point, and I think it is part of the reason boys are struggling and falling behind in our education system today.  There are other reasons, too, such as the fact that boys tend to learn verbal and fine motor skills slightly later than girls, and pushing them to learn to read and write the alphabet in pre-K is often setting them up for failure because they simply aren't ready.  A child who can't keep up figures out that he's a failure, and loses interest or acts out, which leads to more failure.  Many boys actually benefit from starting school a year later than girls.  Another factor is that schools have nearly eliminated physical activity by cutting recess and gym time, which gives boys no outlet for their energy, which leads to too many being diagnosed with ADHD and medicated when possibly the only medication they really need is the chance to run around more.",
