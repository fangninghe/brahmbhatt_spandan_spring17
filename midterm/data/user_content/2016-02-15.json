Overcoming forces of nature is far more difficult than carrying out a targeted, if complex, engineering feet. Cancer is a bit more like a force of nature than an engineering problem, although there are ways to make steady slow progress on some parts of it.",

							"commentBody": "ObamaCare increased the amount of money Americans are paying for health care and that excess money is all going into the pockets of Big Medicine.  As intended.  The drug companies, the big hospital chains [like the non-profit hospital that paid $350,000 to Michelle Obama for a part time job] and the insurance companies are not going to give up any of their profits.  The insurers are already complaining that Obama didn't live up to his promise to guarantee them a profit on their exchange policies.<br/><br/>Moving from fossil fuels to renewable energy increases the amount of money Americans pay for electricity and adds money to the pockets of Buffet, Imelt, Steyer and Musk.  The fossil fuel industries get $8 billion in tax breaks on their tax bills.  The renewable industries pay no taxes and get gifts from the taxpayer of $14 billion and raise the cost of electricity to consumers while they are at it.  The cronies are on the renewable energy side.  Personally, I think that all energy subsidies should end.<br/><br/>What Bernie knows, but doesn't want his followers to find out, it that you cannot raise taxes on the rich, because they have lots of ways of avoiding taxes.  He is honest in saying the middle class has to pay for his programs.",

Why don't they lobby and push billions into  political campaigns to ensure laws to keep health care as a big profit center?  Why doesn't Krugman ever talk about this? <br/><br/>Why do other countries move from fossil fuels to renewable energy at a greater rate than the US? Why do their Supreme Courts not block this, as ours is doing? Surely these countries' big business loves profits too. Yet their societies, with all their differences, are able to cooperate in basic components of democracy. <br/><br/>They use much more public funding of elections, and actually limit private donations. This is not seen as dictatorial big govt interfering with 'free speech'. But let's keep that dark, in case it might give Americans some threatening ideas. ",

While I am only eighteen years old and haven't experienced it yet, I have watched as my best friend's mother has gone through it. Her's was beginning to be so bad that she had to have surgery to help ease the pains. My mother had it early on after she had a hysterectomy. It is a very painful stage of life for many women, and deserves to be given more attention. Women go through so much pain as they go through life, from cramps during menstrual cycles, to giving birth, then to menopause. I don't think women get enough credit for it all. My older sister is having her second child and she is experiencing symptoms far worse than with her first pregnancy. I'm not looking forward to menopause because my periods are already terribly painful, irregular, and last longer than they should. I'm longing for the day when I know longer have to worry about when it will be my time of the month. Men should be more empathetic for all the pain women go through for them. But menopause will always be there as a sign of aging, so why not embrace it and celebrate?",

				"commentBody": "The only thing that surprises me is that no member of the GOP has, to my knowledge, blamed Justice Scalia's death on President Obama.  I certainly wouldn't put it past The Donald to come up with such an accusation (even if he's still working on the location of that missing Kenyan birth certificate).  Nor would I be surprised if such an allegation were delivered by Marco Rubio who just this weekend found a way to blame former President Clinton for the attacks on 9/11.  And, of course, Ted Cruz took it upon himself to lead the charge against the Senate even considering any of the President's potential nominees to fill Mr. Scalia's position.  So little time had elapsed between the announcement of the Justice's death and the launching of this latest Cruz missile that one might have been forgiven for assuming that the Senator had simply jumped the gun again as per his staffers' contention that Ben Carson had put his presidential campaign on \"hold\" (did Cruz even wait for the last rites to be performed?). Naturally, these are the same people who so admired Justice Scalia for his (supposedly) adhering to every syllable and particle of punctuation to be found in the Constitution.  On the other hand, President Obama's insistence on exercising his constitutional authority to nominate new justices to the highest office in the land doesn't impress them quite so much. ",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>JFC,<br/>Will trust you re your facts. Wish to add that Bork was less a nominee than a provocation, politically. Oconnor &amp; Scalia got fast approval with few if any NOES.<br/><br/>News reports tell me that many cases that were likely 5-4 will now be 4-4, meaning Scalia held decisive vote. He was nominated by a prez elected 35 years ago. So built-in checks and balances are best served if a prez who has won 61+% of Electoral College twice this Century sends a nominee to a Senate that is 54% Republican.<br/><br/>The new Justice would, one suspects, resolve those tie votes if the cases are reargued. Seems perfect.<br/><br/>You mentioned Charles's church connection to the late Justice. Learned today that J. Scalia worked in Cleveland for Jones Day. Weren't you with a Cleveland outfit? Also, Son Scalia got law degree @ U. Chicago, now with Gibson Dunn.<br/><br/>My favorite is that the Justice's dad (immigrant) was professor @ Brooklyn College, where my mom got her degree. But Bernie Sanders went there too, then transferred - to U. Chicago!<br/><br/>You know I met the Justice, yes? His intellect was palpable. Also an intensely focussed listener, during Q &amp; A and in our private chat. I told him it was an honor to have him eviscerate my question in the Q &amp; A. It really was intellectually challenging, like Krozel clues.<br/><br/>Oh, and Ms. Totenberg should perhaps recuse from covering Senate proceedings. I like her coverage of cases under consideration, tho. Jan Crawford &amp; Joan Biskupic are better explainers of rulings. Chicagoans?",

Will the President think this strategically. Probably not. Would he get the Democrats on board? Again, probably not.<br/><br/>But I doubt it'll get that far.
