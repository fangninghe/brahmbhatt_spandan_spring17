The fee for checked baggage has led directly to the idiotic overpacking of luggage compartments, tensions between passengers and cre and delayed departures and slowed arrivals. It always, always about money. I knew when they started this trusted traveler baloney that they'd try to force more people into using it by making regular lanes impossible for passengers, and that's exactly what's happened. Hand over all your personal information and pay a fee and then maybe you'll only have to spend an hour in line instead of three. This is all about greed, not about safety.

It is far better to refer to the position of your worthy opponent and explain why that position does not fit the country's needs while giving your own position with a similar explanation.  Both HRC &amp; Senator Sanders did not follow this rule.  <br/><br/>Senator Sanders knew that he was up against one of the most recognizable women in the World, save Queen Elizabeth and Kate Middleton.

Nowhere to be found. He didn't get out and support Democratic candidates in local elections or off year elections and neither did his supporters. He didn't lead the charge to pass all of the legislation Democrats have worked on and his supporters have been missing from the fight.
