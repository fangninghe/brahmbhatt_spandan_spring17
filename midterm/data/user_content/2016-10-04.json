And he was paid a management fee. Wow. Talk about an lucky escape. It helps to be a high roller, I guess.<br/>And all those homeowners who were taken in the mortgage scam, all those retirement accounts wrecked, lives ruined and no help.<br/>As my dear departed mother-in-law would say about all this ...

A decent, intelligent person, one of the billions outside Russia and China who understand the potential disaster his election as President would represent for the planet and the people on it, made a point of supplying the information in a way that they thought would do most damage to the Trump campaign.<br/><br/>Who wouldn't? What all intelligent and decent people on the planet can be sure of is that every other intelligent and decent person on the planet is spending time trying to think of anything they can do to assist Hillary Clinton defeat Trump. It is a comfort.<br/><br/>Of course, the fact that there are about 80 million adult Americans who apparently want Trump to be president is a horrifying and sickening reality we all have to deal with - but there we see the reality of human civilisation condensed into a small, comprehensible nutshell - while a sadly large minority of the human race grow into adulthood as stunted, sick, malign creatures, the majority turn out to be intelligent and decent - or at least on the side of those who are intelligent and decent.<br/><br/>Happily, it has been clear since Day One - if you just look at the polls and don't try to mis-characterise reality - the Trump has never had a chance of winning - but seeing him crushed will still be a relief.",
