				"commentBody": "Once Trump's numbers really started to panic him, his chaotic campaign Chiefs du jour seem to have persuaded him to zip it, read from their prompters, express nonsensical regrets, waver on his absurd deportation rants, and preposterously reach out to minorities that he has insulted all his working life.  The wager is that Americans are such complete idiots that they will forget everything he has said and stood for and believe that the Trump on the choke chain is real now.  the media will laud his new found presidential seriousness, since they need the to be a race that's closer than it is.

Hillary has an extensive field operation in every state (I should know, I'm involved with two states, actually), a robust computer operation (ditto), and tons of identified volunteers waiting the call to help out (ditto again). And Trump has the old republican system\u2014you know, the one famously crashing on election day 2012. The republicans have nothing, and their tiny field operation is not enough for GOTV or telephone canvassing. Sorry, Donald, but you don't have a prayer. So far as the whole republican party goes, I strongly suggest it start reading up on the history of the Whigs, from whence it came.",

In fact, many locals got excited with the Olympics after the opening ceremony and decided to buy tickets for sports events.

I wonder if some VIP guests receive lots of tickets and simply don't go, because this situation is really strange. ",

I feared the new subway line connecting the South Side of Rio to Barra da Tijuca - the suburb-like district of Rio where the Olympic Park is located - wouldn't be ready. I thought I was going to see the same lines for the Christ of the Redeemer and other attractions that I saw during the 2014 World Cup that were very disorganized.  I was also concerned about the huge expenditures on such event, especially with the press reporting that some of the projects had a much higher price tag than it had been previously announced, whereas teachers and police officers weren't receiving their salaries.  However, the 2016 Olympics were successful and it was nice to see so many cheerful people from all over the world visiting my city and learning more about Brazil. In the end, most things went well and the world could see its best athletes doing their job.",
