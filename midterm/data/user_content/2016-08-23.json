				"commentBody": "The e-mail investigation hasn't ever been about something \"sinister\" Clinton supposedly did. That (sounds like) Clinton Foundation stuff, I think it makes sense to consider them separately.<br/><br/>The object of the F.B.I.'s investigation into Clinton's e-mail server, as I understand it, was to find if she violated any laws concerning the handling of classified information. I believe the relevant statute is in Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 793 (f) (<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793)\" title=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793)\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/793)</a>. It seems to me that Clinton is in violation according to the basic sense of the text. I'm not a lawyer, so I've looked online for some kind of explanation. I haven't found anything addressing that point of law.<br/><br/>Unrelatedly: Truth is always compelling, and never boring. Correctness may be slight, because it doesn't have to carry the undeniable force of the phenomena.",

Clinton (note: *not* Hillary Clinton, herself; there's not a scintilla of evidence that Clinton, herself, even knew about any of this) saying, \"I'm not comfortable with this,\" and the exec. then saying, \"Then don't ask.\"  This is the best the right-wing hit squad Judicial Watch can do?

That is potentially quite serious and certainly thumbs its nose at the freedom of information act and the federal records act at the very least. And she was less than forthcoming saying the emails were not classified when in fact some of them were. If she is as smart as they say she  is why couldn't she figure out how (or ask for help) to set up a separate personal email account on her phone? The reason is that she thinks she's above it all and that the rules don't apply to her. Foreign donations to her foundation? No conflict of interest there, right? It's no wonder she has such low approval ratings. Her saving grace this time around is she running against a candidate who is more flawed than she is. ",

In fact, that she went to Powell and asked for advice shows 1) working across the aisle and 2) concern and protection for the office/job.  For those who want a Judge stepping in after the FBI already stepped out, it\u2019s just reality tv mentality.  Honestly, turn it off now please. ",

The alternative hypothesis, in support of which there is a vast amount of data, is that different ethnicities vary in mean IQ. One dares not even discuss those at the low end, but few object to data indicating that European Jews show the highest mean IQ, followed by East Asians, followed by Europeans.  The various IQ tests have been modified for decades in efforts to change these results by doing away with all cultural bias, but the relative rankings remain.  In fact, phsyiolgical measures (reaction time) are highly correlated with IQ and closely reflect the ethnic rankings of traditional pencil and paper tests.<br/><br/>Although no academics are willing to destroy their careers by broaching the subject, these differences have profound social and international implications and must eventually be honestly confronted.
