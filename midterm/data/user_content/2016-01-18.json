Since I had a few letters in the column already -- an E was there -- the only anagramable word(s) in the clue were \"letting in.\" Baffling at first, then not so much.<br/>I love Cryptics! The process of solving them is way fun -- gives the stodgy brain a good jolt or eight in new directions, the way a regular crossword just doesn't do. I work regular crosswords every day, and solving them gives me pleasure, but solving a Cryptic is much more satisfying.<br/>I work puzzles out on paper, no timer, no record-keeping. I'm obsessed enough without going THAT route!",

But if he's President, he'll be bogged down with foreign policy and national security issues from day one, and his economic plan will end up taking a back seat. <br/><br/>I think a combo of Hillary in the White House and Bernie running Finance is the most efficient allocation of their respective talents.<br/><br/>Bernie may win the charm contest, but I don't think the Democrats ought to be electing the nicer candidate any more than I think that Republicans ought to be nominating the most boorish.",
