Only very young and ignorant people think Hillary's case is anything other than radical.",

				"commentBody": "\u201cThose who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201dGeorge Santayana. <br/><br/>That\u2019s the correct saying and to actually understand history, you have to remember it correctly, something Trevor Seel does not do. In 1968 it was about the Vietnam war and Nixon\u2019s \u201csouthern strategy\u201d to take advantage of the reaction to the civil right revolution, especially in the South. Also remember the \u201claw and order\u201d campaign of Nixon and Agnew. The 1968 election most certainly was not simply a battle between liberals and moderates. In 1980, it was about gas lines, inflation, and the Iranian hostages. Without those, one would remember Ronald Reagan only for his Bozo movie. In 1992, just say the words Ross Perot and his 19% of the vote and Clinton\u2019s 43%. In 2000, just say Monica Lewinski. A  large part of the public was totally weary of the lying and morals of Clinton. Clinton could not even help Gore carry Arkansas. How about Gore\u2019s position on guns which lost West Virginia? So if you are going to draw conclusions from history, get your history straight first.",

Donald Trump would be worse.  If enough of you Bernie or Busters' throw your votes away and put Trump over the top, America will be set back for a generation.

Seriously, check out the numbers and the facts there (&amp; the linked sources) instead of repeating the fear-mongering DNC myth of Ralph Nader as spoiler.<br/><br/>3. Do progressive Democrats really think that shaming and hectoring the rest of us works or builds their wing of their party? <br/><br/>Me, I've been a proud Green for years, and have been elected &amp; reelected to local office with my progressive Democrat &amp; Peace and Freedom allies since 2008, so I know that there are great ways and divisive ways to build a party, no matter what the size.",

Does this represent working hard for policies they believe in?<br/>That is what Bernie Sanders asked his \"supporters\" to do. But he couldn't possibly expect cooperation when he vowed to have a contested convention, withheld his endorsement for the length of time that he did, and continued to push the Democratic party's platform further to the left, even admonishing Secretary Clinton for not selecting a more progressive candidate as a running mate. He called a pre-convention meeting on the first day of the convention where he finally asked his supporters to unify and support Secretary Clinton. It was much too little too late.<br/>It is really surprising that Mr. Sanders' \"revolution\" gained traction because he never articulated how he would finance significant expansions of health care, social security, free college for all... Or how he could \u201cbreak up the big banks\u201d without causing significant capital market disruptions. Mr. Sanders has added fuel to the fire of disunity and hatred; his supporters no longer seem to truly care about seeking change for the common good. Their anger, contempt for Secretary Clinton, and antisemitism on display during today's protests are no different than the anger Mr. Trump has unleashed among his supporters.",

You cannot insist that you are pure and good and will not compromise with other people and win an election or make anyone's lives better through politics.  This is not the kingdom of heaven, and while saints are always needed, you will not find one running for office, and surely not winning office.  Their help may come, but not this way.  I'm not sure, to tell the truth, that you are really a saint yourself, and am sure that Bernie Sanders would laugh if you thought he was one.  Best wishes, however, in whatever path you take in future.  I wish you could be of help in this world, but best wishes anyway. ",

				"commentBody": "I have read Clinton's website. It's very impressive. Caveat emptor. I don't believe a word of it.<br/><br/>First, there's the fact that her top \"bundler\" is a fossil fuel lobbyist, and the millions she's taken from fossil fuel industry fatcats. There's her global campaign to promote fracking in other countries which granted lucrative contracts to those same donors. There's the fact that the Keystone pipeline you mentioned was greenlighted and promoted by -- yes! -- the Clinton State Department. There's her promotion of the myth that we can somehow make fracking less likely to contaminate groundwater, when fracking is literally the injection of contaminated water into the ground.<br/><br/>Follow the money, it's the basic rule of politics, especially when there's a Clinton loitering around.<br/><br/>Second: fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. I worked on the campaign of and voted for the man who declared, and I quote:<br/><br/>\"I am absolutely certain that generations from now, we will be able to look back and tell our children that [...] this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal...\"<br/><br/>He then proceeded to oversee the largest expansion of fossil fuel production in living memory. Oh well, I guess we'll need to find a new story to tell our kids. How about the one where we let ourselves be bullied over and over by a nihilistic political Mafia whose Party offered nothing but fear, fear, fear, and identity politics?",

It is time to stand up, to work hard, and above all to vote to preserve our democracy, and it is time to resoundingly defeat the apparent white bigot that the Republican Party has placed into nomination against our democracy. My mother, the poet Jennie Hair (1923-2010) aka M. Virginia Reppert, was a great and pioneering feminist and also a graduate of Wellesley College ('45) like Secretary Clinton. I asked her in the mid 2000s what she thought of Hillary, pointing out that they had the same alma mater. She made it clear to me that she would never vote for someone just because they were a woman, nor because they went to the same school. I think, however, that she would be very proud today, and I wish she had lived long enough to see this moment. My fellow Americans, we are left with no moral choice this fall but to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton the 45th President of the United States.",
