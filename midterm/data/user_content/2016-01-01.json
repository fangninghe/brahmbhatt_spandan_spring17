However, it\u2019s a balanced sentiment understanding full well the arguments on both sides; and it\u2019s a close call. But I\u2019m not sure that everyone would agree, if the main argument in favor of such limitations really was well understood.<br/><br/>Rape often is a very tough crime to prove when memories of an incident are fresh, resolving itself so many times as a case of he said, she said. But with the passage of time, memories undoubtedly become less sharply delineated as they were immediately following an incident, and even more subject to error. With Bill Cosby or even with other, similar situations when the behavior is alleged to be serial and dozens of women have come forward to claim wrong, it\u2019s easier to defend dropping statutes of limitation in the interests of justice; but in situations that are NOT serial and that are decidedly open to interpretation? How long must a person have a Sword of Damocles hanging over his head (or, increasingly, HER head)?<br/><br/>A close call.",

				"commentBody": "No, I don't believe that their friendship was an invitation to sexual assault and rape. I am just really struggling with the idea that a woman (gay or straight, in a relationship or not) at the home of a predatory male would take from his hand three pills, put them in her mouth, and wash 'em down with some wine and not know what the deal was. Now imagine that I am the average woman who might serve on the jury who has had the experience of a man offering drugs and wine while we're sitting on his couch (in my day, I recall being offered weed and cocaine as a prelude to sex). My mind immediately thinks this man hit on me twice, now he is trying to get my defenses down. So if that's not what I want, I grab my stuff and run out of there. This case is not cut and dry. There is reasonable doubt, which means NOT GUILTY. ",

				"commentBody": "The original purpose of the Internet was to provide a cheap and efficient means for scientists to freely exchange information.  As a result, as originally designed there were no obstacles built into the infrastructure to impede the free flow of ideas. The way we use the Internet today is vastly different, requiring safeguards that the original concept never envisioned.  By the time this became apparent, the train, so to speak, had left the station. We now have nothing more than patches for security issues, and sadly, patches have not proven to be the ideal solution for security concerns on the Internet",

				"commentBody": "I developed a system for dealing with anxiety: When that knot in my stomach wakes me up, I lie there in bed, considering each of the things that might reasonably be the cause. Almost always, something turns up that makes the knot far more intense. <br/><br/>Then I make a plan for dealing with that particular issue. Once I've worked out a plan, i find I go back to sleep. If I don't follow up on my plan, a few days later, the anxiety wakes me up again, as a reminder to get with the plan. <br/><br/>While I still do occasionally wake up during the night, there are no more knots in my stomach. That makes it a little more difficult to identify the problem, but the method still works. <br/><br/>So that works for anxiety. As for ants; I've concluded I need to get used to living with lots of life forms I'd rather not have to share my home with. Here in Taiwan, we keep pretty much everything edible in sealed containers. The natives have mostly made peace with that and I, as an American Expat, try to do the same. <br/><br/>One thing I done is to set up a honey feeding station for ants in a place away from food. It seems that ants CAN be bribed. ",

That is rarely a large fraction of one's portfolio.  A staggeringly large fraction of US wealth must be locked in the financial markets where it only indirectly contributes to the \"real\" economy.
