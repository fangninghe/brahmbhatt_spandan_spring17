In other words, nobody says \"can I borrow 100 renminbi?\" (Unless they needed to explicitly distinguish between currencies)<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the concept of qualifiers the short time I studied Mandarin, and how each qualifier has to do with the properties of the thing it's describing. Like \"tiao\" is used to describe \"long things\" like snakes, or better yet \"you tiao\" the long fried donuts.  \"I'll want some donuts... How many?... 3 tiao\". Or \"pian\" used for flat things or slices, like sheets of paper or the sky.<br/><br/>learning chinese or eastern languages not only teaches you how to communicate, but different methods of thinking, counting, etc.",

I was a teenager before the internet, cell phones, TVs in every room, etc., or the concept of delayed sleep phase syndrome. I also had strict parents who kept me and my brothers to a regular, early bed time. I lay awake for hours every night, trying to deal mentally with the energy surge that came at 10pm regardless of how little sleep I got the night before, or how sleepy I had felt at 7pm. Left to my own devices (as I discovered one heavenly year in my mid-30s), I would sleep from 7am to 2pm, with no insomnia and no hangover feeling. I am just sleepy at 7am and wide awake at 11pm. Behavior might be controlled by discipline, but circadian rhythms are not. I think people whose body clocks happen to coincide with what society considers \"right\" have difficulty fathoming, and therefore feeling any empathy for, those of us whose body clocks follow a different schedule.",

							"commentBody": "For many students, enough sleep is not a matter of time management. In the community where I reside, those who wish to remain competitive academically often return home no earlier than 6 pm, what with extracurricular activities and other school engagements. Then, they must study and complete assignments for up to six AP classes, each class requiring no less than an hour of undivided attention. Factoring in other commitments, such as time spent preparing for standardized tests, or writing applications for summer programs and college, it becomes clear that students have no choice but to stay up late. Reporting for school the next day at 7 or 8 am becomes difficult, and even for students who never appear tardy at school, the previous night's hard work and fatigue often catch up to them and lead to decreased attention in class, thus forcing students to stay up even later in order to self-learn the information. This vicious cycle is not created by the students, who have no alternative to sleep deprivation should they desire admission into a competitive college, and so I urge you to consider the demands of modern education and schooling\u2014especially for accomplished high-school students\u2014before claiming that the harmful sleep schedule of teenagers are perpetrated by irresponsibility and shoddy time management.

				"commentBody": "Doubt is what makes us human. Science has nothing to do with religion or belief in a Creator. Science is a system of thought based on observable evidence in conjunction with other systematic forms of thinking, like logic and mathematics. Science is not dogmatic, and its findings are always subject to revision after appraisal of new evidence. No religion allows itself to be revised that way because God doesn't volunteer for experiments. <br/><br/>Judaism has a tradition of rigorous study of religious texts (for men, anyway), with the goal of testing faith by asking difficult and mostly unanswerable questions. Doubt is what creates true faith; without it, \"faith\" is just blind acceptance of somebody else's professed authority. Would that more Christians could understand that. <br/><br/>The Torah, the New Testament, the Qur'an -- they are collections of ancient texts of questionable origins that were never intended to be factual historical accounts or to stand up as coherent philosophical systems. They are anecdotal, piecemeal by nature. The ONLY evidence that they are \"religious\" is that they themselves say they are. That's why they shouldn't be evaluated by an empirical, scientific method. A \"non-believer\" doesn't have to be against religion, but may believe that questions about God are irrelevant to  morality or philosophy (since they get muddied up with religious politics and traditions), or that because they are unknowable to humans, they must always be questions rather than answers.

							"commentBody": "The application of the empirical tests of science to religious claims depends entirely on the nature of these claims. Where they are empirical claims, such as a shroud was worn by Jesus, or the Earth was formed in a few days, empirical tests apply. However, some religious claims lie outside the reach of science, being largely subjective. They are not specious just on that account, and may be very significant to the individual. Being subjective, however, they may not carry the same conviction for others. <br/><br/>The problem to be faced is what to do when entire groups have adopted a set of such commonly accepted subjectively based beliefs, important to the group, and a clash arises with another group of differing beliefs. If the conflicting groups accept their own tenets as a subjective choice, all may be well. But if any group thinks their beliefs are \"better\" than another's, as is often the case, trouble  may ensue. <br/><br/>I am unsure that an argument that \"God is a question\" will settle such differences. As the beliefs cannot be empirically established, finding a basis for persuasion poses a dilemma. Historically the solution appears to be a bloody battle to exhaustion, after which agreement to coexist appears preferable to unending warfare.",

That would tell you that the FBI only wanted Apple to help them get past the \"10 incorrect passwords in succession and the iPhone wipes its memory\" feature.  They did not want to risk losing whatever data was on the iPhone.<br/><br/>To do that you need to either disable the counter that counts to 10, or set the number (10) that it compares against so high that it is never reached (higher than 10,000, the total number of possible code combinations), or reset the counter to zero after each entry (so it never gets to 10), and then you can do a \"brute force\" attack on the password (if need be trying all 10,000 combinatons).  Once the phone is unlocked, it is straightforward to see what is there.<br/><br/>What is so tough about figuring that out?  If you have been programming as long as I have, nothing.<br/><br/>I think Tim Cook was stupid to tell the FBI to \"get lost.\"  He now has the problem that the WORLD knows the iPhone is not invincible.<br/><br/>He could have been aware of everything the FBI was doing if he had played ball. Now he is on the outside looking in.  They can easily tell him to \"get  lost\" when he asks to be told what they did.<br/><br/>But you are entitled to your opinion, just as I am to mine.",

The government request to vacate the order actually says that it \"successfully accessed the data stored on Farook's iPhone\", it doesn't say how, and it doesn't say they unlocked it. If that means they did in fact unlock it, they're silent on the method used.<br/><br/>The point is that we can't actually draw any conclusions from the government's motion regarding the security of Apple's devices, certainly not after the release of iOS 9.3 and the security features of future devices. We also can't draw any conclusions about how the government gains access to data stored on our personal electronic devices. The only thing we know for sure is that this discussion about balancing privacy and security (in its many forms) is far from over.",

Conventional security wisdom has always been that if a determined hacker has physical access to a computer (phone), they can get in eventually.  \"Cloning the drive,\" as may have happened here, would be one way to do that. <br/><br/>The moral of the story for the security-conscious end user: If someone gets their hands on your phone/computer, always assume they *can* access the data, no matter what security or encryption is installed.
