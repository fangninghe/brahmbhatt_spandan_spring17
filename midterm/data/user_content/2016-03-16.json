There is zero reason to believe Rubio's supporters will back Cruz, and I doubt Kasich will be any more effective as spoiler than he was as a candidate. Even if Kasich ties up Pennsylvania and Maryland, Trump will tie up the nomination by California on June 7th, which is the best thing that could happen to the GOP, because a candidate selected by convention would likely finish third, behind Hillary and Donald.",

The simple fact is there are more racists supporting Trump, period.  <br/><br/>\"Cruz was fighting illegal issues\" is an interesting claim given again, the fact that Cruz proposed an amendment to the Senate's immigration bill that would have been favorable to illegal immigrants. <br/><br/>Cruz discussing his proposed amendment, May 21, 2013: \"They [illegal immigrants] would still be eligible for legal status and indeed, under the terms of the bill, they would be eligible for LPR [Lawful Permanent Resident] status....I don\u2019t want immigration reform to fail. I want immigration reform to pass. And so I would urge people of good faith on both sides of the aisle if the objective is to pass common sense immigration reform that secures the borders, that improves legal immigration and that allows those who are here illegally to come in out of the shadows.\" <br/><br/>Rafael Edward Cruz lies about immigration just as much as Trump lies about really having a plan for America.  The reality that Rafael Edward Cruz's doesn't discuss is how his father was a welfare queen living off the government dole, receiving free medical care, education, job training, food and housing, all because he was a Cuban immigrant; allowed under the power of a Presidential Executive Order. Facts? I've got a lot more on Rafael Edward Cruz and I'm happy to share them.  ",

What's common ground for republicans is that they are still in denial that Barack Obama won the election because he is African American.<br/><br/>Historically, freedom of speech was introduced to stop government from muzzling opponents and to protect minorities's rights - voice to be heard in the public space. Recently, and mind-bogglingly, Freedom Caucus and Tea Party goers have gone too far showing pictures of crosshaired politicians whom they don't like at their venues and spreading pure hatreds to certain groups of people. Freedom of speech doesn't absolve someone of moral obligations, for which people have to be hold accountable for what they saying. I'm not suggesting hate speeches ought to be punished by laws but should've been booed down by the public. What's happening is deeply saddening for me.<br/><br/>Another frowning thing for me, is the fact that Donald's campaign has gained so much attentions and supporters. And he will be the nominee in one of our major political parties.",
