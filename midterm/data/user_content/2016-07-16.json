Have you read that? I can't say I have, but the Times reported that he disclosed $615 million in income over the reporting period (12 months?).<br/><br/>People insist Trump should release his taxes. Others insist Hillary should release her speech transcripts. Frankly, I don't feel strongly about either one. Maybe I should, but I don't. If I were Trump, I'd resist. If I were Hillary, I'd resist. If I were one of us, I'd first read what's out there before I get all worked up about what's not.",

Could Trey Gowdy drag Trump before the Senate Judiciary Committee and quiz him under oath? Or do we have to wait for Anonymous to locate and disseminate Trump's tax and medical records?",

To me, it seems entirely legitimate that a group of respected historians wish to express their distress over the very disturbing direction American politics is taking. There are plenty of historical parallels, and understanding them is necessary for the preservation of our fragile democracy.",

So all the imagination in the world, and the best surveillance, are but little protection, especially when vigorous surveillance of a segment of the population perceived as threatening will inevitably turn that threat into reality among a handful of its members.  <br/><br/>What you so readily deride as political correctness is actually correct, as long as it is accompanied by sensible precautions.  In Nice, an obvious precaution was neglected or poorly executed - placing physical barriers between motor vehicles and a well-defined area where a large crowd was expected to gather.  <br/><br/>Like other inspirations of terror before it, ISIS will eventually die out, most likely because enough people in its home ground have had enough.<br/>The Brits, thankfully, didn't respond to decades of IRA terror they way you would have; their response was to go about business as usual - and patience.  Do it any other way and you let the bad guys win. ",

And, gee, Sarah Palin will be staying put because the convention is so far away from Alaska.  Gee, she might even miss a chance to see Vladimir Putin's head hanging over her kitchen window.  Imagine missing a vision like that!  Meanwhile, in preparation for the convention, Trump is inspecting a golf course in Sri Lanka, names Mike Pence to run as his Veep, and other ideas so unrelated to presidential politics that it's clear to me that Trump is not running for office.  He's running away from politics while calling his madcap antics campaigning.  Maybe if we want to turn our US government into a Monty Python show, Trump could find a place for himself.  Or better yet Fawlty Towers where Trump would find himself among varied and assorted seniors in various states of decrepitude, rivaling his madap antics with their own.

Well, I believe we've found the liberal equivalent: liberals who beat their breasts one day over scores of people being killed by an Islamist in Nice, then the very next day cheering on the survival of the Islamist Erdogan government in Turkey.  Again... the so-called logic boggles the mind, proving that conservative and liberal idiocies rival each other.",
