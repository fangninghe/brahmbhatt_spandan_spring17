It was written in 1814 and did not become our national anthem until 1931.<br/> Nor is the freedom to speak ones mind articulated in a colorful peace of cloth.<br/> It is found in our sacred constitution, in the bill of rights. We should consider reciting them all at our patriotic moments. ",

				"commentBody": "I think Kaepernick's motives were to protest oppression, not a demonstration against nationalism. As an athlete, why not question the playing of the anthem before a sports game? He has that right. But I think we muddle his intention by making the conversation about the anthem as a symbol of nationalism, and his demonstration to not acknowledge the anthem. <br/><br/>Kaepernick is a man of color, and I'm sure the past few years, marred by instances of police brutality and racial injustice, have profoundly affected him as they have others, including myself. I commend him for his courage and hope other people of color who are famous continue to speak out against such brutality and injustice. ",

				"commentBody": "I think that the roots of standing with Europe during both World War 1 and 2 gave way to the Vietnam War and the last 15 years since 9-11 so that pride in country and decency gave way to questioning not the men who served, although many did when it was the politicians whose judgement about Vietnam was questioned along with the country, the flag, and patriotism.  Those in the military who have died regardless of the decency of the intentions of some wars versus the questionable nature of others should not be taken out on the military in that the last 15 years and even the first Gulf War, men are having serious mental health issues and physical health issues that are life long.  Athletes unless they have served in combat, have little idea of much of anything dangerous other than intentionally playing sports where they know they can be injured in a split second for the whole season.  But the money makes them indifferent to the likelihood of jnjury, where for most in the military, the money is not the prime motivator for joining the military plus they are never sure if combat will be in the cards.",

Baseball is the absolute worst sport for living in the past and constantly harking back to a simpler time (maybe to distract from today's performance-enhancing drugs and multi-million-dollar contracts). I used to enjoy the YMCA field cleaning song at the Yankees games because it felt local. Agree about God Bless America, a song so awful that Woody Guthrie wrote This Land Is Your Land because he disliked it so much.  ",

I came to see a football game, not a patriot pep rally.<br/>I respect Kaepernick for having the guts to attach his actions to a point of view. He has absolutely NO obligation to stand for the anthem.
