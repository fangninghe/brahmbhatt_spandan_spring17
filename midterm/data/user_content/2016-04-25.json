				"commentBody": "Professor Krugman,<br/>Neoliberalism is a wide spectrum religious cult. I do not see a vast chasm between Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump, Mrs Clinton or yourself. America has become a religion instead of a process as designed by the founders.<br/>The failure to evolve a political process that allows the American people to feel that their government represents their interests has alienated all Americans even those who cleave to an extraordinarily inept former Secretary of State as their champion. America is now a country that now defines its citizens as who they are against. Evolution has made old ideologies obsolete driving cars in Beijing is killing children in Africa.<br/>In 399 BC Socrates was sentenced to death because he understood what many Bernie Sanders supporters know to be the truth  we know we are intelligent because we know that we know nothing.<br/>Neoliberalism is the same as the the religion of ancient Athens. Bernie's crime is corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize the official gods of the state.<br/>I suspect that 2016 will be the last time the United States will see a election where the three final candidates so well define the cornerstones of American society greed, power and corruption. I cannot conceive of any Western democracy where the candidates vying for the highest office in the land seem  too comfortable speaking from the pulpit.<br/>America came to be after Adam Smith and was supposed to have its people determine its destiny. America was to be the end of the invisible hand",

				"commentBody": "Bernie Sanders the independent has spent his political career nurturing the small flame of the post-depression era Democratic Party\u2019s traditions that the party itself has by default almost allowed to be snuffed out.   Much of the party\u2019s view of what kind of nation America should be was part of a governing consensus shared by Republicans as recently as Nixon and Ford.   In today\u2019s political spectrum, Nixon would not find a place in the GOP and would be to the left of the Democratic Party\u2019s managers.<br/><br/>Hillary and the Democratic Party will make an historic mistake if they resist an inevitable shift of the pendulum back towards the left.   I believe that once Hillary\u2019s likely nomination becomes certain, Bernie should give her candidacy wholehearted support.   But the Dems need to stand for something more than just not being the crazy party the other guys are.   <br/><br/>If elected, Hillary could give a couple of good signals, one to inspire the nation and the other to inspire her party.  On inauguration day she could tell Americans that, like FDR, she will be both a pragmatist and a President with big ideas \u2013 the two are not inconsistent.  The next day she could start cleaning house at party HQ. DWS needs to step down in favor of someone who actually cares about a vision for the Democratic Party, not just its nuts and bolts.<br/><br/>Of course if the GOP wins, reshaping the Democratic Party will be all the more urgent.",

							"commentBody": "Mark, it's not about whether I support Bernie or Hillary.  Clearly, I support Bernie.  But there's a strain of Democratic thought that has been decidedly muffled by the party leaders; now, with Bernie's help, it's coming back into the open because what worked in the 90s is no longer working.  If Hillary and the rest of the party leaders are smart, they will understand this.  If they don't, they will ultimately face the same turmoil that the Republicans find  themselves in.  Pragmatism alone does not inspire, and you will need inspiration of the voters to break the paralysis and deadlock of the past few years - in 2018, maybe. <br/><br/>I agree, FDR campaigned on big ideas but in office he was also a pragmatist.  Hillary the pragmatist campaigner would be quite capable of governing with big ideas.  This would not be reversing course, it would be confirming it.",
