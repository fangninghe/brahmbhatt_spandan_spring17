				"commentBody": "Whenever I read a piece about antioxidants I wonder if the proponents have any idea what they are talking about. I am an organic chemist, and yes I understand that compounds that are highly colored often have multiple double bonds that are highly reactive with radicals, but under what conditions? Oh sure the colored compounds react with radicals when you deliberately mix them together, but what I mean is how do these radical scavenger molecules manage to get into the body and travel to the cellular location where they might usefully interact. Everything that you eat goes first to the liver via the portal vein, before it can go anywhere else. Do you know how the liver functions - lots of oxidation reactions. I seriously question whether any of these wonderful \"antioxidants\" ever gets past the liver. Just because something is an antioxidant  in vitro, or has anti cancer properties, or antibiotic or antiviral properties in vitro, does not mean it is useful in vivo, because it has to be able to get to the proper site in the body before it can do anything useful....and most of them don't.",

				"commentBody": "This article has veered so far from the truth. It seems that all publications want to convince themselves and the American people that this jobs report was very good. The truth is there's no wage pressure. Job participation is at it's lowest level in thirty years, and out of the almost 500.000 jobs that were added in the past two months, only 19,000 jobs went to people between the ages of 19-54. This tells us that the jobs were part time, and low wages.<br/>Why do the newspapers and our politicians want to insist that the jobs market is so rosy? Among other things they want to justify the Feds raising rates so the too big to fail banks can make more money and by the way there was no increase in people's savings after the Fed hiked interest rates last month.<br/>The stock market is not buying this. I even heard a number of people on CNBC  of all places stating that rates should not have been raised.",

				"commentBody": "If automation that obsolesces human labor proceeds apace, I suspect that all societies, including ours, will be talking about UBI, at least as an interim mechanism to keep consumer spending up and human misery down. But if we get to the point at which so MUCH human labor is made obsolete that what remains simply cannot generate the economic activity necessary to support everyone else, then we're going to have to invent new economic frameworks we've never seen before to support our vast populations. If we fail, we'll see catastrophic social disruptions.<br/><br/>As to women, I think the focus is too narrow for \u201cpayback\u201d. One means of transferring wealth from remaining producers to everyone else is to start recognizing activity as compensable production that was never properly compensated as production when by rights it should have been \u2013 and child-rearing and caregiving generally would be among my first choices. We\u2019d likely need to use the tax system as the means for effecting the transfer, but we could invent something more or less direct, as well.",

				"commentBody": "The hysteria is warranted:  there were coordinated sexual assaults and rapes on hundreds of women in Cologne, Hamburg and a few other German towns, Salzburg, and towns in Finland.  The media covered it all up, a shocking dereliction of duty to report the news.  Why are we having a discussion about the feelings of the men who committed these crimes and whether they will be offended that we are stating the obvious, that thousands of them across Europe were of the same ethnic group?<br/> A war on women was brazenly unleashed that night around Europe.  If the perps were local nationals, then throw the book at them and put them away for a long time.   If the attackers were refugees and asylum seekers, then they should forfeit the right to live in the West. <br/><br/>Those men - local or refugees - knew wrong from right but decided to prey on physically weaker victims.  These were crimes of control and delight in the infliction of terror.  Subjecting them to culture classes will do no more than lecturing to murderers that taking a life is wrong. <br/><br/> It sure would be nice if the politically correct would stop throwing women as a group under the bus in the name of trying to judge these mass atrocities as some kind of balancing test.  Punish the offenders and keep anyone with the mindset that women are fair game to be raped out of the West, period.",

Only 30% of Americans own guns, down from almost 50% in the late 1970's.   Fewer people own guns, but many of the ones who do own guns own LOTS of them.  That's the scary bit.  A gun in the home to protect the family is fine and rational.  But there's a hard core of gun nuts out there who own a whole garage-full of them.  That smacks of addiction.  Most folks can have a drink or two of an evening and not do anything stupid, but some people drink a whole bottle of gin and are the worse for it.  Those are the ones who are scary, mostly because there's no rational discussion one can have with an alcoholic.<br/>J",
