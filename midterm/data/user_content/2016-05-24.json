				"commentBody": "I disagree with the premise for manyf reasons, in particular that because Sousa (an American) supposedly alone represents all Marching Band Music to the world, that all styles of music must be represented by a single person or band.<br/><br/>Which single person represents classical music? It is Bach, Mozart, Beethoven or someone else? The answer is all of them, and many others, some not yet born, and that's just composition (similar to Sousa) but not musicianship, which includes many people not known for composing.<br/><br/>Who represents Jazz? Certainly Louis Armstrong comes to mind, but how about Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis? And that's just some Black Jazz musicians and composers.<br/><br/>Regarding Rock n Roll, personally I think Buddy Holly is more important than Elvis. And Little Richard might be more important than either. And Ike Turner invented Rock n Roll with his recording of 'Rocket 88' in 1951 - it even has the word Rock within its name.<br/><br/>I've long considered Rock to be a different form of music, than the earlier and generally more primitive Rock n Roll. In the USA, Rock, as a newer form, started with the second British Invasion, but did also include the Beatles and Rolling Stones. The Stones certainly always rocked more than Beatles. I enjoy both.<br/><br/>Rock includes sub-genres, including Blues (Cream / Clapton), Country-Rock (Byrds), Folk-Rock (Dylan). How about Hip-hop? And forms not yet created?<br/><br/>In 300 years, many musicians / bands will still be known.",

				"commentBody": "Dylan gets way too much ink largely because rock writers usually come from  English major-type backgrounds, not art or music. They're drawn more to banal poetry. Many low-talent kids who started rock bands came from upper middle class backgrounds &amp; have a hang-up about wanting to be more black &amp; soulful than they were raised. Net result: mediocrity, white blues.Rock became guitar-obsessed,probably more market to sell guitars than accordions post 50's.<br/><br/>Bowie, Roxy Music, Genesis, Yes, King Crimson flowered from English imagination, not just trying to be Black Americans. Cultural slobs write endlessly about punk while trashing prog because they think art that aspires to greatness or is beautiful isn't hip. Motown was beautiful.<br/><br/>Anyway, ABBA was loved by Lennon, Townsend, Strummer (Clash), Sex Pistols. Even Fripp &amp; Eno respected ABBA. They were excellent songwriters &amp; producers.They could do straight-up boogie woogie or disco. <br/><br/>Agnetha &amp; Frida's harmonies were so tight, their voices forged a pagan alloy that could cut your head off like Viking steel sword. Plus their spandex &amp; miniskirts were what rock &amp; roll has always been about. As Bjorn sang, \"Rock Me.\"<br/><br/>Finally, the most accurate but macabre metric of true rock icons: tragic &amp; bizarre drummer deaths. Moon, Bonham, Porcaro, Spinal Tap... Brunkert. Re: ABBA v. Kiss controversy: notwithstanding Carr's tragic but not bizarre death, only way Kiss could be great if Criss catches a nasty case of impetigo while dressed as a cat.",

				"commentBody": "Music is never remembered for its social meaning or impact. Only historians and activists are interested in that. It is remembered for its musical qualities. And in three hundred years, no music that even today resonates mainly in the Anglosphere will be remembered in a culture that is trans-global and maybe transhuman.  <br/><br/>You have to look at models of what's remembered today: a bit of European music 1700-1950, in places where the economic conditions permit its mastery on a large scale, regardless of culture; some American and Latin jazz from the 30's through the 60's; and increasingly, selected traditional music of Africa and Asia, again where conditions allow people to learn to play and sing it.  One has to consider that, in 300 years, the world may be (I said MAY be) a richer, more unified, and smarter place. The peculiar market and social conditions that created rock will no longer exist. People will have their own musics. Listening to 20th-century rock will be an esoteric pursuit and all that will figure in it is: does the music engage musical sensibilities in ways that invite the listener to listen again and again. My money would be on the Beatles.  The rest is mostly sociology.",

				"commentBody": "The beauty of any music that is popular in its time is that it continues to build on what has come before.  Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis took Gospel, country and blues and created something different.  The Stones took Chuck Berry and blues and Motown influences and made their own sound.  You can hear echoes of the Sex Pistols in Nirvana's music.  The first time I heard Cage the Elephant I thought that is what the Beatles would sound like if they were still playing today.<br/><br/>When I was growing up in the late 60s and early 70s, the local rock radio station was incredibly diverse.  I listened to Motown, Elton John, the Beatles, Pink Floyd, and yes Elvis, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard, all on one station.  Now of course, rock has expanded and grown, we have all these different genres and radio stations tend to stick to one or two.  But R&amp;B is still rock, and so is heavy metal.<br/><br/>Thanks to recordings (and assuming humans are around and continue to have the technology to play and create them) there will still be rock and roll in 300 years.  Yes it will sound very different from what we think of as rock today.  But Avenged Sevenfold sounds very different from the Beatles, and they are both rock and roll, separated by 50 years in time.",

Too bad you missed out on the Beatles' arrival in America, because you would know that the Rolling Stones had nothing close to that kind of thing. The Rolling Stones are great, great (read Keith's autobiography, btw), but the Beatles are the Beatles. ",

				"commentBody": "This is an absurd premise! U.S. military marches are nothing at all like the genre of rock. First of all, marches don't have subgenres, because they all had the same purpose: a marching band had to march to them, and they were generally for the morale of the military. Rock has a lot of subgenres: see punk, death metal, etc. Second, marches as such were pretty specific to the eastern U.S. for a pretty short period of time, outside of military usage. Rock music is a worldwide phenomenon. Third, nobody was writing march history as it was happening. Rock books are ubiquitous.<br/>However, 300 years ago there was something called the \"classical era\" which included Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven, to name a few of the obscure--you wouldn't have heard of them--composers. And what is the state of classical era music today? Is it still played at live concerts and on recordings? Does anybody know anything about it (did someone say sonata form)? Do we have to choose Mozart over Haydn over early Beethoven as the sole proprietor or can we sprinkle in some J.C. Bach or C.P.E. Bach or Muzio Clementi? <br/><br/>Rock music is going to be fine. In 300 years people will no doubt be composing \"neo-acid rock\" if they haven't already.",

				"commentBody": "Even though this article doesn't spend much time on the reason rock became dominant, it was actually the invention of the teenager AND the invention of the transistor that made it happen. Before the transistor radio, adults had control of the bulky stationary radio console that doubled as a piece of furniture in the living room. But teenagers could take to their transistor radios to the beach and listen to whatever they wanted (which unbeknownst to them were rhythm and blues tunes appropriated from southern blacks), and eventually they had more power than the adults in determining what kind of music became popular. So hats off to physicists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley, the inventors of the transistor, which led not only to the transistor radio, but to the space program, GPS, personal computers, iPads, iPhones and our entire gadget based society.",
