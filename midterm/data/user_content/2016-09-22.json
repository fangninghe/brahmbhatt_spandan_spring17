Does this mean majority of our police officers, despite being armed with deadly weapons, are cowards with neither courage nor the resourcefulness to deal with difficult or just moderately difficult situations?<br/><br/>It breaks my heart to say this as I am a cop fan, with default admiration for people who put their lives on the line to protect others. I feel like I am forced to see our police officers differently now after so many of these unnecessary shooting deaths.<br/><br/>At some point, it becomes clearer that it is not just isolated bad apples or isolated bad calls, but our police has a systemic culture of being scared of black people, prematurely labeling them criminal, reactively use unneeded deadly force.<br/><br/>My children are biracial but appearance wise look like African American.

So we are in no position to judge them when guns are involved. \"Seemingly not so threatening\"? You can't really say till you've been there.<br/><br/>Sterling and Castile both had guns. You can hear the panic in the cops' voices on those videos. (\"He's got a gun! Gun!\" \"I told him not to reach for it!!!\") Proof they don't just make that up. So do you count these as \"unnecessary shooting deaths\"? From someone who would never dare to face a gun, it takes some gall to judge others.<br/><br/>And in a country as vast as America, these events really amount to nothing, not \"so many.\" Magnitudes more killed by guns in all sorts of crazy situations every day, and you live your life just fine not noticing all those. All this attention is wildly overblown. Don't go out in public high on some drug and/or carrying a gun irresponsibly. Those things will get you in trouble, and one or both of those always seem to be a feature of these incidents. White guys doing these things get shot and killed, too. Relax everyone.",

Judgment enforcement would be a pain, but it is so in any cross border enforcement proceeding, isn't it? The Saudis' export of violent Wahabism is really what's on trial. The US people help to bankroll that retrograde regime - great if its evil doings were aired in a court and what better circumstance to utilize than the tragic 9/11 attacks? I have full confidence that the Saudis will hire great lawyers, delay for years while they transfer assets out of the US, so won't hurt them economically ( except the outrageous legal fees!) but will make a strong statement to these creepy religious bigots.",

That's a page right out of Putin's thin book, same excuse as the hit on the convoy, which some on here seem to be attempting to gin up as a conspiracy - have mercy on your sad, confused, apologist souls.  Aid workers and roughly 750 lbs of much needed food and medicinal supplies were destroyed as aid workers unloaded them and then another strike when medics rolled up to assist.  If it wasn't Russians flying those fighters, perhaps it was ISIS.  That second followup attack is right out of the ISIS field manual.  Shady.  <br/><br/>I say we get shadier and confuse a few more Syrian army barracks for ISIS positions.  Perhaps do the same with Assad as well.  We'll have another failed state for ISIS to rape until they are driven back, however, ISIS gives up land much easier than Assad.  Russia so obviously breaking this cease fire and in such an horrendous way, deserves them their boy goes away.  The hopefully they go away.  The country is already in ruins, hundreds of thousands have died, many more escaped to live in tent camps, pimp themselves in Beirut.  The country is failed, lets put it down finally out of mercy so all can move on.",
