Including those that may have hacked her server. Cause despite your research talking point, Comey stated that they wouldn't fine evidence if they had. He also found it likely more than not because of the locations she sent and received from.  What does any of these released emails have to do with your assertion of \"personal\" deletions?<br/>Also, just because a opposition adversary digs the dirt, doesn't make it any less true.  Thus you need to stop with the assertions that all criticism is Reichwing.  Cause lord knows the left couldn't find their own. Right Susan?  The truth is what it is, whether it comes from a left or right.  Obviously the left has done a poor job of vetting Slick Hilliey.  She was crammed down our throats from the get go. Imagine people being upset about that.  Hmmm...<br/>Here is a \"fact check\" giving HRC 3 Pinocchio's for her lies and deception on the emails from the beginning. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/07/05/revisiting-clintons-claim-she-used-personal-email-out-of-convenience-and-it-was-allowed-by-state-department/\" title=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/07/05/revisiting-clintons-claim-she-used-personal-email-out-of-convenience-and-it-was-allowed-by-state-department/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/07/05/revisitin...</a>",

							"commentBody": "Here's the problem.  (aside from the unnecessary dig \"Reichwing\")<br/><br/>It's the double standard.  People come in a wide variety, which is great. But attacks on Hillary are out of proportion to what she did, and one side is eager to fan the flames. Since Judicial Watch has still not been properly exposed, and Republican opposition work is so deep and wide, the picture is distorted. Republicans never admit weakness or break ranks.<br/><br/>I often refer to climate because that's where I'm bruised and battered. When one side never lets up and uses every trick in the book, it's hard to say, yes, people are flawed, but that's who we are, and that can be a good thing.<br/><br/>On the whole, Hillary, a busy woman, appears to have done what she could in complicated circumstances, and I'm inclined to think the whole email attack thing is overblown and driven from the right.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, none of this leaves room for me to say, yes, I want universal health care (good luck with that), yes, I want to redo military history and stop ruining other people's neighborhoods in the name of being the world's policeman, yes, I want to go back to Eisenhower-level taxation (look it up, it's staggering), yes, social security and sales taxes are regressive, yes, the Clinton and Obama shouldn't have caved (as if they had a choice) after we didn't support them in midterms, yada yada yada.<br/><br/>I voted for Bernie, but in the end I got tired of his lack of a plan and over a decade of uncompromising repetition.",

Others not so much.<br/>Such is life.<br/>Thus, not all criticism is/are rightwing points.<br/>You seem to be willing to give a pass to Ms. Clinton on her emails.  I, not so much.  Show me the \"personal\", then maybe I'd hire her.<br/>As for Bernie, one must start out with the \"Big Ideas\".  One has a cabinet and negotiations to try and make it happen.  If one starts out compromised, as BHO always seemed to do, as Dem. politicians always seem to do, as HRC sounds/seems willing already to do, then half the win is already in the oppositions court.  Yes, politics is a give and take.  Why do we always seem to give from the start?  I prefer Sanders style. We do know that the Amendment King knows how to bargain. And he gets his ideas implemented as best as he could. Especially when even his so called Dem. caucus wouldn't sit and listen, much less work for his \"unicorn'' ideas.<br/>Better than nothing, sometimes is not good enough.  Kinda like Climate Change.  We do or we don't and perish.  Should we compromise on this to our detriment when we know we are right?<br/>Such is life. Good luck with your choice.  We will all need it.",

It is the right thing to do, an accepted protocol all presidential candidates have dutifully concurred with for fifty years.<br/><br/>As far as the Supreme Court is concerned, Republicans have abused the majority they've held for over fifty years because they've used their court majority to push their agenda forward rather than legislating.<br/><br/>In the past six years, in all three congressional sessions, the Republican controlled House has been the least productive since we've been keeping track. When Senate Republicans gained the majority in 2014 they followed the House in failing to legislate. Prior to that, they abused the filibuster to block legislation more than any other party in the history of our country. Rather than make laws, they sue or a conservative group sues for them. Then, the conservative majority usually finds for them. <br/><br/>That's how we got \"Citizens United\" and the decimation of the Voting Rights Act. It's why business seems always the victor over labor. It's why so many Americans are disgusted with Congress. Republican obstruction is the primary cause of Congressional Gridlock.<br/><br/>It's time for a Democratic Supreme Court majority. Let's do it in November by electing Hillary Clinton and let's end Congressional Gridlock by electing a Democratic Congress that will actually start legislating again and restore honor to the legislative branch of government.",

Even before then, Republicans met secretly to oppose almost every piece of meaningful legislation he sent to Congress, even if it meant hurting the country - and they talked about patriotism!  I keep hearing reporters say over 2/3 of Americans believe the country is going in the wrong direction, yet Obama is quite popular.  Has any one stopped to think the wrong direction could be faulted to Republicans?  I also agreed with you that what they could not block in the Congress they used Republican Justices on the Supreme Court to override.  It was these justices as you mentioned, who Deprived many Americans the right to vote and their Citizens United have severely undermined American democracy which likely contributed to the rise of Trump.  But given he is who Republicans have now selected to be President, one can be charitable to Rep. Sanford.  At least he offered a valid argument and he did not overtly insult all Americans and belittle the country even though many of us can be offended by his behavior while he was Governor.",

Honestly it can be almost impossible to figure out who actually wants to help and who doesn't, and I haven't found that the manner of offering correlates with the willingness to help.  A few people kindly offered specific help, and I was able to explain why I did or did not need that kind of help.  But I say to call on others to do things that need done.  Yes, some will let you down, but others, and often people who you didn't think would even care much, will come to your aid brilliantly.  ",

But since the Feds have the option every month to change rates, even inaction is a form of action.  So, technically, if not meaningfully, Krugman's counsel is for inaction in the face of doubt. But, actually, there is no way to for the Fed not to have an effect on the economy whether it stands pat or raises rates. So they're stuck with doubt no matter what they do. This is a case of which is the lesser of 2 possible evils.",

In my case everyone seems surprised at how well I'm doing.  But we did approach it somewhat differently than some.  We told almost no one until I had a firm diagnosis and treatment plan.  And even then we didn't tell a lot of people, but we got a lot of support from the ones who knew.<br/><br/>I was never angry, although I had the advantage of a pretty good prognosis if I could survive the treatment.  And surviving the treatment is easier given a good prognosis, so that was a big help.  I did have an episode of worry, but it turned out to be a panic attack caused by a medication imbalance.  I sometimes wonder whether my attitude during my brutal radiation treatment was kind of pathological, as I didn't go through the stages of grief or \"why me?\"  (Why not me?  I figure it's all a crap shoot, and I lost, temporarily.)<br/><br/>I also had the advantage of not having watched commercial TV for decades, so those terrible ads never penetrated my consciousness.",
