They have convinced a significant part of the Republican Party that the country is in terrible shape, despite unemployment being low, interest rates being low, and the stock market at an all time high. There are always people who struggle with jobs and the economy. Some are still recovering from the Great Recession. But thankfully many of us are not. People need to stop and assess whether they are worse off than they were when the economy crashed in 2009-2010, when Obama took office, and stop listening to Trump tell them they are worse off. <br/><br/>Lies, damn lies, and statistics. -- Benjamin Disraeli.

Yet no one in the Republican elected leadership stepped forward to renounce his lunacy. Both Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell dodged questioning by the press choosing instead to allow Trump to erode at Mr. Obama's perceived legitimacy .

				"commentBody": "What is being described is essentially getting in contact with parts of oneself that are dissociated from conscious awareness and that somehow (with perhaps genetic roots) break through into voices heard as alien, coming from outside the self.  Conceptually, this is not that different than most of contemporary psychoanalysis, a cluster of views called relational, that attempts to connect a person with those disowned parts in the context of a therapeutic relationship.  Given the low level of most psychiatric treatment, these groups look promising.<br/><br/>While it may be walking a risky road for those hearing voices, once one begins to make friends with alien parts of oneself, they can lose some of their toxicity.  So it takes a skilled and supportive therapist- or perhaps the support of the group described hear- to provide what the analysts call a holding environment.<br/><br/>As an analytically oriented therapist I never understood why what I do is called a medical procedure, other than that meant that patients I see can get some insurance coverage.  So we play the game.  And also because the drug companies needed discrete medical entities to market their many products.  <br/><br/>This has taken us away from looking at the meanings of a symptom- why is this happening, what function does it serve, how do the voices protect you, what are you scared of, are you scared of me?-  and how this plays out in relationships.   Some people may need medication; some may not.  It is not an either/or.  ",

				"commentBody": "In my experience I have found it interesting that the tradition of Western Psychiatry and the Esoteric tradition often overlap in their observations.  But use different terms and come to different conclusions.  For instance Psychiatry calls \"telepathy,\" which by definition has no audio component, \"thought-insertion.\" But it seems to me that Western science is ridiculously biased against the Esoteric tradition which seems to be such a totally unscientific stance.  Since human beings have found the Esoteric tradition to be enormously helpful for many thousands of years (in fact I know of no pre-modern human culture which was able to survive without it), it seems to me that this is an area of human experience which is ripe for brain research.   I hear that our government thinks so also.  Yes...I would put one of my eggs in this basket... but not all.",
