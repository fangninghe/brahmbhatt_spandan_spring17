She's tried so many times to quit.   I have read articles that compare nicotine addiction to heroin addiction, and I believe it. But the help that is given to smokers is practically nothing - nicotine patches, a drug with terrible side effects, or mostly urgings by doctors to quit, using will power.  Will power worked for me, but I think that in-patient rehab should be available to smokers, just as it is to drug addicts.  Why don't insurance carriers provide serious help for the deeply addicted?  Believe me, it would have been cheaper financially than the health care they must provide now to my dearest.  Watching someone you love slowly decline, unable to breathe - it's terrible.  ",

				"commentBody": "\"mandatory and verifiable nicotine rehabilitation\" What is that?  If they made inpatient rehab available for nicotine addicts as they do for heroin addicts, that would be great for the deeply addicted.  But although you and I can quit with will power, there are many, many who can not. All the nicotine patches and Chantrix in the world will not work for that level of addiction.  I hate the tobacco companies, and I am enraged that the States settled those tobacco law suits and did NOT develop any plan for helping addicts quit.  Here in Pennsylvania, there is a state-funded support telephone number, period, end of help.  That is nothing, nothing, nothing for someone who is deeply addicted to nicotine, although it does terrible damage just as heroin does.  ",

But I will quit again, I am very disciplined when I put my mind to it. No worries there. But I do want to say, that in comparison to my non smoking friends and family, I rarely ever get a cold, respiratory infections, sinus infections or have allergies. I don't think I have been prescribed antibiotics more than 5-6 times in my life. I have a healthy complexion, no wrinkles (I do stay out of the sun, wear sunscreen). Good genes, probably, thank God. But I will quit smoking soon, why -- I don't like being held hostage to what is arguably a smelly, unpleasant, socially repugnant and expensive habit.",

				"commentBody": "My boyfriend smoked for decades, oblivious to the dangers - and since he appeared to be in the best of health, nothing could dissuade him; in any event he believed in living for the moment; all<br/>I could do was open windows whenever he smoked.<br/><br/>Two years ago he was diagnosed not with lung cancer, the disease I feared, but with cancer of the tongue. Radical surgeries spared his life, but he aged 10 years overnight and can no longer chew food - no more going out to eat, or travel as he loved to.  In remission, life is now infinitely precious.<br/><br/>He says he never expected this to happen; but alas, had someone warned him, I think he would have nevertheless continued with his habit, since it is hardly news that smoking is bad for your health.",
