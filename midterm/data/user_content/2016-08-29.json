				"commentBody": "@Jeff Stockwell<br/>The problems you mentioned are not unique to China, examples abound in the USA as well. China in 2008 surpassed the US as the worlds leading polluter but comes no where close in per capita pollution levels. You want to make China out to be an unimaginable ogre and its prison environment may qualify but the seldom analyzed US private prison system is now coming into the headlines grimly. Both lead the world in death sentences. On mortality rates, US infant mortality rates are higher than those in 41 nations including China; the life span of the average person in China in 1950 was 40 years; by 2011 it was around 76. (The average life span in the United States in 2011 was 79.) Pew does comparisons of citizens attitudes, you might check those out and see who fairs best. Time perhaps to rewrite your assessments.<br/>The Transplantation Society\u2019s critique of China\u2019s use of prisoner\u2019s organs was formulated on lack of consent, but in all likelihoods was underlain by the knowledge that such practice will become a profit driven enterprise without constraints in a prison environment. Whether it has been abandoned needs inquire not just opinions. This article does not help much.",

				"commentBody": "The crackdown on Falun Gong was almost two decades ago. Within China, Falun Gong has become essentially non-existent, and it will be hard to find prisoners currently jailed because of practising Falun Gong. So the treatment of Falun Gong practitioners, and whether there were systematic harvesting of their organs, concerns the past, and is kept alive because some Falun Gong followers overseas remain active. <br/><br/>Chinese political system is highly centralised, but it's also very difficult to enforce laws and orders uniformly across the country, especially when it conflicts with local interests. It's extremely unlikely that the central Govt would order or even condone harvesting of organs of Falun Gong practitioners because of the potential international outcry. However, at the local level, there is economic incentive to profit from organ harvesting on death-row inmates, and conceivably also die-hard Falun Gong followers who would not recant. <br/><br/>Lastly, it should be pointed out that Falun Gong does have certain cult like features. It was one of many different meditation sects in China at that time, called Qi Gong, which supposedly help circulate Qi in the body and cure one's own, as well as other people's illness, even terminal illness. It is a mix of meditation and religion. Unlike other Qi Gong, Falun Gong is more exclusive and forbids its followers from practicing any other form of Qi Gong. Followers are also advised against seeing doctors for illness.",

							"commentBody": "Falun Gong indeed had practitioners on the order of tens of millions in China at that time. But the vast majority of them practised it in the hope of improving their health and would not cling onto it at the risk of going to jail. The percentage of hard core Falun Gong followers who hold it as a religious belief is extremely small. If I have to make a guess, I would say probably in the low tens of thousands all over China. It is very likely that many of them suffered various degree of abuse in police custody, and some of them died with organs taken for transplant. But I don't believe there could have been a coordinated effort nationwide to harvest the organs of Falun Gong followers, because no official, high or low, would ever want to be associated with a program of murder. Higher level officials have nothing to gain by coordinating such a program, only everything to lose. Whatever happened, could only have happened in the dark at the local level, for profits. The smaller the locality, the less the oversight, the more likely abuse took place. <br/><br/>Such profit driven abuse are not unique to China. In every developing country, whatever the form of Govt, there is various degree of corruption and abuse. It's just that for countries with authoritarian govts, it's easier to pin all the blame on the govt. That's why when abuse takes place in democratic third world countries, they attract much less western media attention, because there is no simple narrative as to whom to blame.",

							"commentBody": "Of course, the Govt crackdown on Falun Gong allowed the possibility of large scale abuses. If it was another group that did not have the political taboo attached, there would have been more exposures of such abuses that act as a check. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not trying to excuse the detention, abuse, or even murder of Falun Gong followers, wherever they occurred. But the data is scarce and the facts are hard to pin down. In western media, there is a tendency to exaggerate because it fits the narrative of an evil authoritarian Govt. Just as people were eager to believe that Saddam Hussein hoarded weapons of mass destruction. But the reality is much more complex. The investigations cited statistics from some Chinese hospitals, and that hospital staff is ready to comply with patients' request for organs of Falun Gong practitioners. But why should one just trust what they say, when they have an incentive to lie to attract business? The bottom line is that, without reliable data, it is simply not possible to draw strong conclusions. If anyone claims otherwise, then one should be skeptical.",

As usual, the foolish babus in South Block do not understand how they lose the battle for media sympathy. The jihadis in Kashmir will use women and children in the front lines in same manner as ISIS.<br/><br/>Second, all the Paksitani sympathizers should understand that the chances of India ceding any part of J&amp;K territory to Pakistan to an independent state is about as real as the South successfully seceding again from the United States. Wars have been fought and won over Kashmir. It does not matter a whit what Muslims in the Valley feel about independence, having driven the Hindus out of the Valley to refugee camps in Jammu and elsewhere. The only way Kashmir will ever be independent is by the destruction of the Indian nation state. I wouldn't hold my breath on that possibility.<br/><br/>After Partition in 1947, million of Muslims and Hindus left their land and moved across the border. The families of both my father and mother were among those refugees. If Kashmiri Muslims are so unhappy in India's rule in Kashmir, they should just pack up and leave, just like my grandparents did from East Pakistan and moved to India. ",

These leave the barrel had hundreds of feet per second and can break bones or even cause death; the protocol is to bounce them off the ground, but as you imagine they get fired at a parallel to ground trajectory hitting people straight on.<br/><br/>For pure crowd dispersion, tear gas seems a better option.
