Like I wrote before; Americans are enslaved by Television and movies, both of which promote guns resulting in  the national fetish with guns and many killings.<br/><br/>Choosing a General Petraeus as a Secretary of State is a prelude to war as you can imagine he would accentuate military cooperation among allies. <br/><br/>Choosing Price as his HHS secretary and his disrespect for women is indicative of similar attitudes by Trump. Don Trump has never had  a problem getting medical care and additionally, the Republican's are the party of death that believe in survival of the fittest unlike Christianity that was duped into voting for Republicans.<br/><br/>This all looks very incestuous and out of Trump's hands. Perhaps this is all payback for RNC support that got Trump elected.<br/><br/>You will all be thoroughly duped for the next four to eight years by Television and Movies.",

							"commentBody": "Rational people tend to respond this way to ignorance, childishness  and stupidity leading to national damage IJReilly.  Part of being \"worked up\" is to realize how the system works which allows us to gauge the \"consequences\" of a given action.  If the consequences don't square with claims we have a problem.  For example, I say I  will help the forgotten workers of America but my appointments result in typically GOP tax cuts for rich people. Tax cuts for rich people will not bring the coal jobs back or prevent automation. I could go on but this should get the point across.  Vote as you eat: unless you are in the 1% do not assume that voting for billionaires will help the working or middle classes.  America was \"Great\" in the 50s and 60s because cold war competition with Communism resulted in policies promoting a middle class.  Voting for Reagan and his successors has not  recreated the Truman to LBJ boom years. ",
