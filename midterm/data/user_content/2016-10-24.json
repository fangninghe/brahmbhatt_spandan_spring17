Dump out a box of them to start building with, they are Legos, not Lego - there is no kid with a bucket of them, no parent who bought them, who doesn't know the word is \"Legos\" (and not \"Lego bricks\" - especially not nowadays when half of them are not bricks in the least).<br/><br/>I like that Martin Freeman / Stephen Colbert story. Legolas, in Tolkien's elvish language, means (shining-) green leaf (his name is sometimes rendered that way, Legolas Greenleaf.",

Sure, we're going to have to suffer thru probably an entire season of Rick going all Cool Hand Luke fetching the shot turtle, but you don't have to be a cannibal to know he's going to eventually get his game on and make good on that promise (yet again); preferably with that leftover RPG, tho the smart money is on Negan getting his ax back.<br/>(For my part, I'd have taken the arm and had Maggie kill herself once they were set \"free\" just to keep the piling-on of the first half of the show going; it would have taken the scripting from exceptional to epic.)",

What I missed was DVRed or caught up with on marathons. The character development was beyond fantastic, and the artfully done, non cheap looking zombie props and prosthetic/special effects always fit well with story, giving The Walking Dead and great feeling of realism, as well as producing great emotions in its audience almost weekly minus a few underdone episodes.  The psychology and chemistry between the characters and their strange new world and us the audience was always 4 1/2 stars. And of course those we lost along the way ..well their deaths were not pleasant nor unexpected, but the sole focus was not gore but rather story.<br/>Tonight they went for the graphic shock effect and did it with top dollar props. The label that some might find this program disturbing was an understatement, and the labeling should have been somehow MUCH more graphic to fit what we were about to see, may they be fined!  By the time Glens eyes was out of his head but he was still alive I was changing channels.  The show has turned to shock and gore to capture it's audience, that is a sign of weakness, of desperation and is offensive to the more intelligent fan base who are watching for sheer, GOOD story, though I am sure it will collect the younger fan base. And inspire some real life murders with baseball bats and barb wire. I will not be back.    ",

We all knew you would be killing off major characters, but that was beyond sadistic and horrific, and I had the sound off for parts of it and watched out of the corner of my eye! Killing zombies is one thing, the level of torture to humans in this episode was over the top and unnecessary to depict how evil and sick Negan is. We get it, you don't have to hit us over the head with it repeatedly, pun intended. ",

I started a career in the health care field with direct patient contact at all stages of life and end of journey situations. I soon realized that I had a very tidy and romanticized view of the death process in a medical setting. I quickly learned it was frequently not fast and many times it was dragged out mercilessly even when the hope of a return to previous level of function and stable health was gone. I think the breakdown occurs when patients and their families are not provided enough information about probable outcomes. Families and patients need an advocate in that setting who can unemotionally give them facts so compassionate decisions can be made. And they need time to process the information. Our Social Workers and Case Managers need the luxury of more time with these patients to make the transition easier.",

Her sister and I are working on getting them transcribed and edited.  It is a wonderfully cathartic undertaking, as we get to continue to hear her voice and experience her complex mind.
