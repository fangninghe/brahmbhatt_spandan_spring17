Bernie's spending assumed giant economic impacts in specific areas like healthcare and education that no model outside of Gerald Friedman's supported, kind of like the GOP assuming that every tax cut under any circumstance results in the same bang for the buck.  Something most models (and the real world) don't support without some serious number-fudging to 'close the deal' with the public.  (The latest version being 'dynamic scoring' of budget proposals)  But it just sounds so plausible it MUST be true, right?  Cut taxes equals increased spending equals increased economic activity, right?  Wrong.  Initial conditions count, sometimes extraordinarily.  So, too, with Bernie's proposals.  Fiscal expansion under 'whatever excuse' isn't an excuse to spend irresponsibly.",

				"commentBody": "I had long been a football fan, having grown up six blocks from the old Yankee Stadium and taking in many Giants' games with my dad in the 1960s when he had season tickets. He became good friends with several of the Giants through legal representation and later on was friendly with Ron Johnson. They played tennis together after Johnson retired, but Johnson later suffered from severe  neurological issues ultimately diagnosed, I believe, with early onset Alzheimer's Disease. Nobody knew at that time the degree to which football destroyed the body bit by bit, especially the most vital organ, the brain. But we unequivocally know that the contact involved in youth football is particularly damaging to the brain. The still developing brain is susceptible to significant damage from just a few hits to the head at the age children play Pop Warner. There is no way to prevent it other than to not participate. The damage only increases through high school, college, etc. The medical and scientific evidence is undisputed, despite those opposing who have huge economic interests to keep the gravy train running, similar to those climate change deniers who will continue to whistle in the dark. Football destroys bodies and eventually minds. ",

But there is something unsettling about parents who sue Pop Warner and USA Football for terrible injuries and the deaths of their children from playing football, which they themselves signed them up for. It's like smoking except no one forced you or enticed you or addicted you to have your kids play football. Once the parents became aware that football at any level is a dangerous game (and everyone knows that for years) they are the ultimate responsible party for their kid's injuries. Believing that helmets protect kids from injuries no matter what fake info that is based on belies common sense. A lawsuit brought by an injured child against his parents for signing him up for football makes about as much sense as those brought by the parents. No sport is injury-proof, but some are worse than others. Find the safer ones and promote them. ",
