				"commentBody": "Your tax rates are disingenuous.   The people in those countries don't pay 6-13% in state income tax, nor do they pay $20K a year in property tax on their houses.   You have to look across the total tax burden from all jurisdictions.   The 19.2% of GDP figure looks low, but it is only the Federal share.<br/><br/>As for spending, you have to throw away money numbers and look at reality.   This is the amount of actual goods and services produced and consumed.   Would more goods and services be produced if the government printed and handed out money?   Do we have vast reserves of additional people who could do useful work?   If we define useful work as producing an output worth more than what they are paid, the answer is probably no.    So that puts us in the position of the USSR tableware factory that produced spoons and forks worth less than the raw materials it used.   We would be destroying wealth, not creating it.",

				"commentBody": "I live in an export dependent country (New Zealand) where the $NZ falls in times of economic adversity as investors put their $US/Euros/Yen in safe havens. So a loss in exports of firms due to reduced sales to overseas customers is compensated for somewhat by increased per unit revenue in $NZ terms.<br/><br/>Having that cushion gives NZ firms breathing space to adjust costs or rejig their product mix in order to survive.<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin a fall in the NZ dollar makes life more difficult for importers and means imported goods are more expensive.<br/><br/>A variable dollar gives New Zealand the time and flexibility it needs to adapt as circumstances change. If we were part of another country's currency bloc we would lose this important buffer feature.<br/><br/>The point made by some commenters that Germany is able to export high value goods and so everyone else should as well - for a start Germany entered the Eurozone when it had low input costs relative to it's past. So in those terms it has a permanently low currency to export in.<br/><br/>When Italy or France cannot devalue, their firms don't get the same time to adjust that NZ firms do with their flexible currency.<br/><br/>If you have an export culture then when trade barriers are removed you can do well. If you are a culture/nation that has traditionally relied on your own consumers for sales, then open trade means firms take a lot longer to adapt or they fold. Without a variable exchange rate to help, often the pressure is too much, too soon.",

The need for nuance and richness of variety in linguistic expression is so deeply ingrained into the human mind that any spoken language offers roughly the same breadth of possible expressions with all the subtlety and nuance that is required.<br/><br/>Funnily enough, speakers of languages with a richer morphology than English (German, French, Russian, Arabic - the list is endless, since English is especially lacking in overt morphologiocal markers) often (wrongly) cite English as being a \"poor\" language since it does not allow for the subtle shifts in meaning that can be accomplished with grammatical markers or reordering of words.<br/><br/>That is of course, not true. Languages achieve their variety and richness in different ways - where Russian, for example, encodes aspect and modality with grammatical markers, English often has to resort to using whole phrases (or tense) to express the syntactic concept of aspect for a given verb.<br/><br/>What you're saying would imply that speakers of some languages cannot express the emotional, social and intellectual richness of their lives and culture as much as speakers of English can. That is an offensive and somewhat imperialist point of view that has no basis in reality and is not borne out by linguistic research.",

Think, for instance, of Yiddish, a language that developed by largely persecuted people to hide their true meaning from the \"others.\" Elements such as indirection, inflection, and reversal become essential parts of the language to facilitate communication among \"us\" while shielding true meaning from \"them.\"<br/><br/>William the Conqueror in 1066 brought French into Old English, greatly expanding the soon-to-become common tongue on the Island. In addition, English is much more of a decriptive language than is French which, because of the cultural authority of the Acadamie Francaise, leans toward the prescriptive. ",

Imaginably, even from the dawn of philosophy, there may have been those who've disregarded developed thought,  projected through lengthy, convoluted sentences,  appearing irrelevant  to the here and now.<br/>Though admittedly drawn to philosophy,  at times leaning upon it, the well written article on \"Is That Even a Thing\" aids me in understanding all those whose lips curl up and brows bunch over critical,  when anyone waxes philosophical.<br/>Please take this not as a critique, for I am not nearly in the position of passing criticism on any doctoral candidate in philosophy rather, I would hope, that this thing that we're doing here, this repartee of sorts, would draw attention to the need for the interjection of philosophical thought in our daily lives, our private lives and the way we live as a community, locally and globally.<br/>While at very deep meaningful levels, the understanding of how we have come to use the term \"thing\" might unlock heretofore hidden expanses of neurology and the \"behavior\" of our thought,  there remain other areas of existential relevance that philosophy may  contribute to.<br/>Philosophers,  see the relevance of you're studies.
