					"commentBody": "Hard to imagine an op-ed equating Obama's foreign policy with Trump's - but I just read it, so I know that it actually exists.  I guess we need to consider the source.<br/><br/>The author is a co-founder of the Project for a New American Century - that cabal of chickenhawks who brought us the Iraq invasion, and who would best serve their nation today by agreeing to either spend the rest of their lives in inconspicuous political exile or behind bars.  Either would do - but I would prefer them behind bars.<br/><br/>Virtually everything bad that has happened to the Middle East since 9/11 is their responsibility.  They took a region that was troubled yet stable, and made it infinitely more troubled and unstable.  In the aftermath of that terrible day, they exponentially increased the number of Muslims interested in committing murder and mayhem, instead of reducing it.  The blood of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, is literally on their hands.<br/><br/>For those you more interested in dollars and cents, they saddled this country with trillions in unnecessary debt.<br/><br/>Trump will likely prove a disaster as President, particularly in the foreign policy area - but it's not as if these chickenhawks represent a better alternative.  The neocons are the textbook definition of doing stupid stuff - and yet they resolutely refuse to learn from their mistakes.<br/><br/>Having to choose between Trump and a neocons is like having to choose between cancer and Alzheimer's.  Either way, you're screwed.",

(And sadly, this not a unique case...)<br/><br/>One of the most pernicious aspects of this whole trend of \"disguised content\" and analysis, is the blurring of the line between honestly exploring ideas or presenting personal opinions and cloaking partisan points of view to pass off as objective! <br/><br/>This bad for \"journalism,\" bad for the vital truth-telling function of the news and the news media, and bad for respect for \"authoritative\" news-people and sources of info!  It's a key reason that many real news-seekers are turned off from our formerly-respected sources of news and info.  <br/><br/>In a sick climate like that, the most absurd, illogical, and blatantly nonfactual 'info' gets strewn all over the media (and especially internet and social media!), and all sorts of fakers, double-talkers and outright liars get credibility they don't serve in their absurd statements and positions!",

Have you worked for down-ticket candidates?  have you attended their dinners, cookouts, and get-out-the vote events? Those are the people who make a party.<br/><br/>The Superdelegates are the leaders, movers, and shakers of a political party;  they're chosen by the other active members of the party who share their same values and principles.  You get a voice--you are invited to express your opinion during the caucuses.  Maine caucusers have great influence, but they can't expect the party to just turn the keys over to people who stay home during mid-terms, who vote for Republicans sometimes, or who embrace some spellbinder who doesn't embrace the party's principles.  That all being said, in your caucus Sanders received 64% of the votes and got 68% of the committed delegates.  The seven Maine Superdelegates represent just 22% of Maine's say on who receives the nomination.   <br/><br/>Even were all 32 Maine delegates to be awarded by the caucus results, Sanders would receive just four more delegates more than he would receive if all seven Superdelegates support Clinton.  Ignoring Superdelegates entirely, Clinton still leads Sanders by 283 delegates, with 835 still to be decided, requiring Sanders to capture 700 of those 835 votes just to tie.  It doesn't appear that four extra Maine delegates is going to change the outcome.",

He is collecting a lot of donor money which he has not used to help any other Democrat.  He is not a member of the \"establishment\", and thank God for that.  It is cringe making to think of him yelling at our allies.  The kids who think of him as a kindly grandfather who will put them through college for free are not going to vote in any numbers larger than they did in the mid-terms when their absence gave us a Republican House.  They stayed home in a snit, as they plan to do now.  When will these adolescents grow up?  Maybe they agree with that actress who said that electing Trump would serve us right.
