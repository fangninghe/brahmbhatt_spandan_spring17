I look at the photos included in this article and I see a bunch of young folks who have likely never even bothered to read the proposals or bios of the two candidates.   They are the shiftless crowd, down on their luck, and united in their hatred for rich people.   I get that.   And so, of course, does Bernie.  He doesn't even have to get into the nuts and bolts of his proposals.  He doesn't have to explain anything.   Just repeat the same stump speech over and over and over, yelling out AT the crowd, and taking no questions.   An old man selling the impossible to keep those donations coming in; when he knows, and everyone on his team knows, he cannot win the nomination.    Free education, as promised by Bernie, will be metered out to the States for implementation.   One look at the States Legislative map and it's one big sea of red.   Good luck with that Bernie.   He hasn't been confronted hard enough or often enough to explain the impossible junk he is promising to so many \"revolutionaries\" with glazed-over eyes.    ",

Younger folks living with parents or roommates are supposed to start out in such positions and advance forward with experience and training (education in this case not always required per se).    In American capitalism, we are supposed to earn our wages as we earn our position in life.  A living wage implies that you are living within your means for what you're making, and if not, it is not always pay that is the single culprit. I recall reading about a man who pays $400/mo to live in a cardboard box in a friends apartment in San Francisco.  If he must live like that, then it's the city he chose to live in that could easily be to blame, regardless of wages.  I lived in NYC once and now live very comfortably in scenic Montana for less than I was making in Brooklyn a year ago.",
