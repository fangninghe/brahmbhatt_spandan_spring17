The prospect is only slightly better than a President Trump.  Neither of the Clintons have any concern for the struggles and suffering of the working class of this country, or any other.  (In fact they'd like to \"bring ALL of us to heel.\")  She will not hesitate to use the children of the working class as cannon fodder for her warmongering.<br/>Yes, she is a woman - so was Margaret Thatcher....

However, a lot of what has been proposed has failed (encasing the waste in glass), and the practical problem of moving nuclear waste around has run into NIMBY problems nationwide. Technical solutions are not solutions if they are socially unacceptable. <br/><br/>If you build into the price of the electricity generated by nuclear power the cost of building and decommissioning the plants (never been done, but the estimates are in the billions and the taxpayers, not the utilities, will pay) and the cost of disposing of the waste in a safe, permanent manner, it no longer makes sense to build these plants. There's are good practical  reasons people haven't built one of these monstrosities in 30 years despite the \"technical\" solutions of the engineers.",
