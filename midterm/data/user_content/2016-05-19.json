					"commentBody": "I think Sanders makes a strong point, even if his chances of gaining the nomination are slim. The Democratic party has been moving leftward over the past eight years of the Obama administration. Hillary's incrementalism, her neoconservative tendencies on foreign policy, and her overtures toward Trump-skeptic Republicans are big reminders of the triangulation that her husband was well-known for. After the progressive gains of the past eight years, Democratic constituencies are not interested in triangulation, and a continuing challenge by Sanders ensures that the party stays true to its current direction.<br/><br/>In addition, Sanders has a point about the way the party has conducted its primaries, caucuses and debates. The DNC, under the direction of DWS, has been favoring Clinton from the get go. I won't engage in the conspiracy theories put forth by the more, er, passionate Sanders supporters, but the DNC's favoritism has been incredibly unseemly. The DNC should not tip the scales in such a way. If Sanders can wrest reform from the party by staying in the race, he will have done the integrity of the party a favor.",

This \"leftward moving\" Democratic administration has been pushing TPP, it has prosecuted more whistle blowers than the Bush administration before, it has done nothing about the Wall Street crooks who pushed us into the 2008 financial met-down, it has passed Obamcare which is right from Nixon's universal health care plan proposal (and which was 100% based on a Republican developed proposal), etc., etc. The Obama administration has been as corporatist as anyone can imagine, indeed far beyond.

					"commentBody": "I think a lot of Clinton supporters don't take the differences between Sanders and Clinton supporters seriously. They think that the policy differences between the two candidates are exaggerated, that they're more style than substance. Since they see Sanders' campaign as pursuing a not particularly worthwhile cause, they obviously see it as a threat that Sanders may undermine Clinton's chances in the general election. They're also more likely to frame the issues in terms of headline politics: oh, someone threw a chair or the equivalent in Nevada, that must be what Sanders is all about.<br/><br/>But I think that it's a mistake to think that the fight within the Democratic party is an insignificant one. Since the 70s, the party has been so scared to tack to the left that it has ignored a large part of its base and has compromised a good deal of its essential values. Sanders presents a more egalitarian vision for the country than does Clinton, and it's important that our leftmost major party have an ideal like that to stand for.<br/><br/>Democratic party leaders have also been unaccountable for their past failures. Today Clinton says that she regrets voting for the authorization of the use of force in Iraq and for her support of the 1990s crime bill. Perhaps she is, and that's good. But we have elections, not to extract contrition, but so that there are consequences to bad decisions like those. Hopefully the next centrist Democrat thinks twice about making such decisions in the first place.",

All the super delegates must revert to neural position and make the decision at the convention providing reasons for their preference.

					"commentBody": "Bernie is advocating for the party to be opened to all, forgetting that the reason he's even done so well is precisely because the party was wide open, allowing him to convert to Democrat at 11th hour so that he could take advantage of its infrastructure and primary process to launch his candidacy - advantages he would not have had as an independent candidate. Moreover, the party's nominating rules were already in place before he decided to run, so that none should have surprised him. After initially railing against superdelegates as \"undemocratic\", he and his supporters are now  talking about flipping them to win the nomination even if he still trails in pledged delegates and total votes. In short, Bernie and his supporters are ready to  use undemocratic means if that is what it would take to win him the nomination, while they continue railing against a system they see as \"rigged\" and undemocratic!<br/><br/>Bernie the sheep has completely disrobed and the wolf that was lurking underneath is now fully exposed for all to see. His transformation from a candidate who'd once defended Hillary against email-server-gate to one \"willing to harm her in the homestretch\" is nothing short of extraordinary. No bona fide Democrat should take a chance with a candidate who is clearly willing to literally crash the Dem Party  because he's come up short. <br/><br/>America has never elected a candidate from the extremes of the political divide. Hillary is where most voters are and is thus our best choice!",

Yes, I agree that the delegates screwed up by not registering or showing up, and rules are rules and currently state that this disqualifies them; fair enough.  My point is not about the Sanders or the Clinton campaigns; I'm not taking sides there or saying that anything was rigged or unfair.  <br/><br/>My point is about the delegate system and rules I think need to be re-thought for the future:  I'm saying that currently the system is such that, if person A--one single person--screws up, that results in the votes of thousands and thousands of voters being thrown out, and that's a problem.  If that is happening, the voters' voices are at risk of not being heard because of the screw-up of single individuals.  We need to have a system where votes translate more directly into electoral results.   I'm not claiming anything was rigged or unfair, just that we have a problem that needs to be fixed, for the future.",

She has been beating him overall in a landslide which wasn't the case for her against Obama in 2008.  So in my (non-magical thinking) world, a reasonable challenger would first tone it down, organize his campaign around taking the high road and choosing a few agenda items he'd like to push; and when he sees (after Indiana primary when Trump became the sole nominee of the other party) that there's absolutely no path to the nomination, he drops out and works to saving our democracy from the incredibly destructive forces lining up to support Trump.",

					"commentBody": "I would like someone to explain what Clinton would do differently if Sanders were now out of the race. I grant some campaign mechanics would change. But to what imaginary \"center\" would she pivot, where the largest blocks of voters she must win over are Sanders' younger voters and the independent working class white voters over which Sanders is already battling Trump. What are the \"radical\" positions to which Sanders has pushed her that she might advantageously soft pedal or repudiate? It's not as if she is any longer spending much money or effort addressing Sanders' most barbed criticisms of her campaign financing. She's certainly no longer prepping to debate him. She effectively has the nomination locked up. So who is this more competitive Hillary whose emergence is being mysteriously held back by Bernie? <br/><br/>I can think of no more compelling case Clinton could make for her own candidacy to her own supporters and to Sanders' than going, no holds barred, at Trump right now, indeed, yesterday. The core discomfort with Clinton has always been that she and her campaign exude an air of \"entitlement\" and a dangerous penchant to sit on a lead and \"triangulate\" rather than actually leading. Nothing would better dispel that than a show of justified confidence in her nomination and a bit of fight. This constant whining out of her camp about Sanders and his supporters not giving up a lost cause just looks petty and weak. Not the impression one wants to make facing Trump.",

When it came down to tallying the votes, in my opinion, Mr. Gore acquiesced \u2013 he simply didn\u2019t have the fire in the belly necessary to claim the presidency. I\u2019ll never get over that.

Clinton is not nearly liberal enough for me. But I will vote for her. I think she\u2019s a decent person who occasionally got some stuff wrong. (Join the club.) The status quo I hope she will maintain will be the continuance of societal advances fought for over the past decades including reproductive rights, gender rights, affordable healthcare, family rights, labor rights.<br/><br/>I don\u2019t know what Mr. Trump is up to. I can\u2019t tell if he\u2019s pulling the Republicans to the left or pretending to do so long enough to snag ambivalent Democrats and then revert back to right-wing-land right after the election.

Those numbers would change drastically once the Republicans began to attack Sanders's history.<br/><br/>Because of Sanders history as an unrepentant socialist, he is the candidate that would be easiest for Trump to defeat because Americans are deeply suspicious of socialism.  <br/><br/>It calls to mind 1972 when Edmund Muskie would have been the more formidable opponent of Richard Nixon.  The Nixon campaign succeeded in sidelining Muskie and getting George McGovern.  McGovern won only two states and Nixon was re-elected.<br/><br/>This year is too important, with a Supreme Court vacancy not being filled because of the obstreperous Republican Senate, to have a longtime socialist as the nominee of the Democratic Party.",

Finally, he is getting the attention he has been craving during his decades-long activist and political career.  In the process of achieving his \"revolution\", he is willing to destroy the Democratic Party and risk electing Donald Trump to the Presidency. Gone are the days when he acknowledged that Clinton was just as much a progressive as he was. Now, in his effort to take over the Democratic Party, he and his staff and supporters have adopted the long-rehearsed Republican talking points about Hillary Clinton, along with accusing her of selling out to the big banks. He has no chance of being the Democratic nominee or being elected President. If he were to be elected somehow, he has no concrete plans for accomplishing his goals, other than having a \"revolution\" and calling his supporters to the streets. He and Trump are distorted mirror images of each other, both wanting to retreat from the world; both with extreme America First views; both appealing to mainly-white, alienated, politically naive constituencies; and both with a core of fanatical supporters who are willing to engage in verbal and physical violence. The Democratic Party should not cave in to Sanders's extortion. He has taken advantage of the Party and there is no excuse, other than sour grapes, for him to complain about Party rules this late in the game.",

After all, why is it incumbent on Sanders or Nader to send their voters to the Democratic centrist candidate? Stamping one's feet about it makes no sense. As one Nader supporter once pointed out, he isn't a Democratic voter, he is a Green Party voter. He didn't owe Al Gore his vote. His vote needed to be earned.<br/><br/>I think the Democratic Party has grown complacent during the Obama years. I hope Clinton and the Democratic leadership don't make the mistake of pandering to the center while taking Sanders voters for granted come time for the general election. ",
