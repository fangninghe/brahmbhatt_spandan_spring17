				"commentBody": "This is irresponsible reporting by a sanctimonious Nicholas Kristof.<br/><br/>The real crime is having large families in an overpopulated world.  Honduras has a population growth rate of 2%, which is unsustainable in the long run.<br/><br/>We don't know exactly what happens in Honduras, but when the growth rate is this high, the ultimate results are always gruesome.<br/><br/>In some cases it is outright starvation.  More commonly, high birth rates lead to social disorder, the spreading of crime, disintegration of the family, and the building up of ghettos.<br/><br/>It is a human rights abuse for countries like Honduras to keep their people from having access to safe birth control, and to abortions when those are necessary to limit family size.<br/><br/>And liberals like Kristof are also guilty of human rights abuse when they fail to note the connection between high birth rates and devastating drops in living standards.<br/><br/>One thing is certain.  The crimes of the officials in Honduras who prevent the maintenance of small families to protect the planet should NOT be visited upon Americans by Obama's illegal acts of providing amnesty for an unlimited stream of illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>We need to control our borders and maintain respect for American laws.  At the same time we need to recognize the crimes of governments like those in Latin America which prevent family planning, and perpetuate poverty by preventing birth control and abortion.<br/><br/>America needs a one child policy.  So does Latin America.",

							"commentBody": "In the long term a reduction in the population growth rate would certainly be a benefit. But it's not going to do anything to solve the immediate problem of criminality facing families like those described in the article.<br/><br/>It seems in many countries that the population growth rate reductions FOLLOW from increased education and economic opportunity. By focusing FIRST on population growth rates I believe you are putting the cart before the horse. By all means if we are going to try to help in some way, then one of those ways should be to support better family planning. But that must be part of a package that includes improved education, business development, increased transparency in government and its related reduction in institutionalized corruption, as well as assistance with policing.<br/><br/>It would also be helpful if Americans stopped buying illegal drugs originating from Central America. American drug users are currently financing a large part of this criminality.",

There are few English speakers.<br/>I've spent the equivalent of a year there since 2011, traveling alone, or with Salvadorans on intercity buses, on foot and in private or rental cars, and have yet to be even threatened in El Salvador, though as one of the few foreigners out in a he country, tall and blue-eyed, and an accented Spanish, I stand out.<br/>Yes, there is violence, as I read in the local papers. Most do not want to leave but the extortion and lack a of opportunity is the problem. The people I know in the western towns are not leaving and the streets are bursting is a large, heartening population of school children.<br/>Once you he gangs are extirpated, and the that's what it will take, and some opportunity, tourism will begin, for better or worse.

The San Francisco Bay Area is probably the best example.

It all worked out so well for Erdogan and reminds one of the 1933 bombing of the Reichstag which provided Hitler with the ability to take control of the gov't completely, purging anyone who had stood against him. That said, I would agree that the US has an abysmal history of supporting military coups and I'm glad we did not this time, in spite of the fact that I believe the whole thing was orchestrated by Erdogan.

It's a sign that they don't think their religion is strong enough to stand on its own merits if they cannot operate as Democracies do, with lots of religious beliefs and atheism.
