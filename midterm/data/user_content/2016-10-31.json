				"commentBody": "We don't even need to make \"for profit\" colleges illegal.  We just need to  invest in public institutions - K-12, community colleges and state universities - making sure that there are good paths to college as well as vocational schools to train students for crafts like welding, construction, auto mechanics, electrical work and plumbing.  Make state and community colleges free or low-cost, as was the case in the 1960s and 70s.<br/>The same tax money that is being wasted on profits going into the pockets of 1-percenter shareholders in the for-profit 'education industry', would be better spent directly building our state institutions.  This is not just fair;  it is also good economics.  Students who have an easier path to graduation with fewer  financial obstacles will graduate in greater numbers and enter the workforce with better skills, in higher-paying jobs.  When they finish, they will not be burdened with loans, nor will they be paying a huge percentage of their income to send their own children to college.  They will therefore be able to save more for retirement and participate in the economy more.  Being better-off, they will pay more taxes and buy more cars, houses, vacations and everything else that makes our economy grow.   ",

				"commentBody": "I didn't make up the 87% statistic; this has been studied as you can see for yourself through simple online searches. In spite of the truth that automation is really driving the vast majority of manufacturing job loss,  many Americans think that free trade agreements are the main driver, and both Trump and Clinton are at fault as well.  Finding an economist that thinks that enacting more trade barriers will significantly increase U.S. employment is like finding a climate scientist who thinks global warming is a hoax; you can find them, but they're few and far between.  <br/><br/>As a case in point, Foxconn, the company which assembles the iPhone in China, just reduced its Chinese work force by 60,000 due to automation.   If cheap Chinese labor can't compete with robots, then, yes, I will tell you that the vast majority of manufacturing jobs in New York and elsewhere were lost to automation, not to free trade agreements.  And it is going to get worse, not better.  Just wait until autonomous vehicles eliminate 5 million truck, taxi, and Uber jobs.   ",

				"commentBody": "I think William could be the MIB. <br/><br/>Maybe I am just remembering it incorrectly, but we don't actually know that MIB raped Dolores in the first episode, do we? We just see him drag her into the barn.<br/><br/>Is it possible that he is William and because we are seeing the narrative from Teddy's POV at that moment that's what we are led to believe? Maybe once in the barn something more significant happens. She certainly flashes back to something having happened in the barn later on when she runs in there on her 'loop', but at the time I think we are supposed to assume it is a rape.<br/><br/>The other thing I have begun to suspect is that Logan and young Will are hosts. I think that Ford might have planted them there deliberately to see if Delores really does know anything about Arnold (if she has communicated with him etc) Because I think she knew the MIB/William in his YOUNGER days. I suspect she may even have been *based* on his fianc\u00e9e- Logan's sister. And the only reason that William or Logan has not been killed is because the other hosts are programmed not to - with the updates Ford has given them. <br/><br/>This would explain why Dolores can report back each night whilst in their company and why William suddenly seemed to go on 'autopilot' when shooting the union men. It was like he was programmed to do it.<br/><br/>In this respect, I fully expect the MIB to not be a villain.",

Do you recall all the attempts at marketing \"Global Investing\"? That money was used to build the foreign factories that took American workers jobs whose pension money was used to build the factories that took their jobs.<br/><br/>Globalization and \"Global Investing\" is a Wall Street endeavor we have all come to resent.<br/><br/>Remember the \"Occupy Wall Street\" demonstrations? They were right.<br/><br/>Remember that the NYPD sided with big money, as they always do, and abused those demonstrators who made sacrifices in the national interest, something Wall Street did not.<br/><br/>It wasn't entirely the fault of Corporate executives for abandoning America. It was instigated by Wall Street who commanded extraordinary cost cutting to maximize stock values and dividends.<br/><br/>Trump need look no further than his own Manhattan Island to effect change.",

It worked and soon the Lexus dealerships' used car sections were packed with Benzes and Beemers.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to my point that worshiping at the alter of quarterly profits is short term thinking at a point in history that the long view is the better way to see things.",

				"commentBody": "We worked with Inner Mongolian herders for 4 years to create a sustainable supply chain for cashmere and camel fiber. We learned that herders know how to manage the fragile eco-system. Sadly, the Chinese government, and some national and international NGOs, argued that \"exclosures\" fencing out herders and animals, would stabilize the desert. There is indeed often a sudden dramatic increase in biomass when no animals graze. However, when drought occurs, the unpruned/overgrown plants cannot survive-too much energy into top growth,not root growth.   Any long term solution requires a delicate balance of land, carrying capacity and grazing animal pruning. We found a combination of goats and camels was most sustainable.<br/>Our experience with declining water tables- they were caused as much or more by mining than climate change. Trees that had survived for centuries, and were sacred sites, were dying because deep open pit mines pump out massive amounts of water, which is now polluted and runs across the surface of the desert adding to herder problems.<br/>We found some wonderful people working on the preservation of herder sustainable grazing practices and herder culture, both of which hold the solution for stabilizing deserts in Ningxia. They are  fighting an uphill battle and sadly climate change is adding to the challenges: 1) it objectively aggravates desertification, 2) it provides a too rarely challenged excuse for forced relocation of indigenous, largely Muslim, people.",

Think about what \u2018government policy\u2019 may look like in the interim.<br/>Anthropologists see a basic difference in social structure between farmers and herders, farming requires cooperative agreements primarily in water utilization and thus community centered decision making.
