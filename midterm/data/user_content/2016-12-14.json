				"commentBody": "Elizabeth, I agree with you that Steve Bannon is at the root of these destructive choices. In fact, I strongly suspect Trump couldn't even name one of \"his\" nominees without mismatching the nominee with an agency or department.<br/>This is deeply troubling to me--to us all of course---because I don't think the goal is allowing private business [and bankers] to sweep in for the kill. They've already swept.<br/>Please forgive me if I sound like a fruitcake when I suggest this is an attack on our nation as a whole. Think what the U.S. would be if everyone of these nominees is permitted to follow their \"dream\" of destroying their least favorite agency or department from within.<br/>Yes, sure, Putin or some other foreign actor might be behind this. Or just Bannon.<br/>Let's go back a few years instead to Grover Norquist browbeating GOP candidates into signing his document pledging no new taxes. What was Norquist's next step? Making the federal gov't \"small enough that it could be drowned in a bathtub.\"",

I don't remember the press camped outside Bill Clinton's transition team's offices, and I'd have tripped over them if they were there.

				"commentBody": "A few harmful inaccuracies about your post. <br/><br/>Training to muscular failure does not obligate bad technique or form, like you implied. There's no evidence that shows the former must lead to the latter. This is a sloppy statement.<br/><br/>The use of the word \"functional training\" is vague at best, and at worst setting a premise that training a muscle in isolation is somehow dysfunctional. In many people and for many reasons, training with machines or isolating body parts is the safest option to increase muscular strength, hypertrophy and cellular metabolism as a critical factor in improvement of sugar and lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity.<br/><br/>Your experiences hardly make for proof and makes for an unscientific statement. There are too many variables in training that makes it unsafe, such as improperly managed progression, volume and frequency. <br/><br/>Training for more muscle mass, which is one of the strongest independent predictors of all-cause mortality, and which is a direct constituent to greater number of mitochondrial growth, is in itself highly functional for humans.",

				"commentBody": "It is these types of stories that helped give the impetus for us in NY to seek to become licensed Sleep Techs. Over the decade long struggle we were able to achieve this milestone, which provides a state license/registry for anyone wishing to perform ANY test dealing with a sleep disorder. YES, that includes Home Sleep Testing.<br/>So, it is NOT OK to just pick up an HST from an office worker in a doctor's office. YOU, Mr. Ms. NY Citizen have the right to be educated and instructed by a qualified professional (Doc, Nurse, RT or Sleep tech) who can explain the issues regarding the test and the disorder.  These mail order (or as I call them, Helicopter testing) are the rage, as they take almost zero start-up costs and have little operating overhead. Of course there will be charlatans. I remember seeing a magazine ad touting that for just $6000 a company could set anyone up to provide HST (Home Sleep Testing) with no background checks.<br/>As the article mentioned, but not many practitioners follow, the simultaneous disorders (comorbidities) that should keep you from using HST is long, and as another poster mentions, the field recognizes that only people with a HIGH-LIKELIHOOD of having sleep apnea typically should be tested using HST.<br/>I think we will be in for a more tumultuous time for our healthcare provisioning as Precedent trump repeals the ACA and puts a much more costlier and rapacious \"free-market\" based healthcare construct in place.

After all, one just needed to persuade about 100,000 people in well chosen states to believe in nutty things like Pizzagate.  As was seen in DC this week, such people are around.  And no, many of them seem quite unable to distinguish fact from fiction.",

				"commentBody": "Perhaps this attack on the very foundation of our democracy will teach liberals/progressives that the whole \"dark web\" of propaganda, foolishness, and actual leaked classified information provided by the likes of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden is (shockingly!) quite dangerous and at odds with an open liberal democracy.<br/><br/>And I am not a conservative, but a quite proud liberal.  And yet, my compatriots are still on the fence over whether anti-American fake news / propaganda is a threat to our way of life.  Whether Mr. Trump had an active or passive role in the transfer of Russian-gained information on the Dems to WikiLeaks, he has shown himself to be amoral to the greater issue of whether the USA stands up to Russia on the basic matter of freedom for Eastern Europeans.",
