Given the speed which the Murdochs are moving on this, there is a very high likelihood that the accusations are true, or at least some of them are. The absence of these facts in the reporting would be expected as these situations are generally well-guarded for many good reasons. I think your conclusion (nor your characterization of \"just an accusation\") is not supported based on my own direct experience with such matters in global business enterprises.",

				"commentBody": "Ryan, if you were a woman, particularly an older one, I think this would \"pass the smell test.\" I can tell you dozens of stories similar to this, not just in television but in many other businesses. There were apparently enough other women who experienced similar \"proposals\"  and spoke to the company's investigators to lend credence to Ms. Carlsons story but I'd wager many of those women never went to HR or spoke up before as it would've meant their jobs. HR is a company apparatus and the most powerful person in the company generally gets to stay.  Just because Ailes presumably hasn't harassed the women who defend him doesn't meant he didn't harass the others. And just because Kelly praised him and credited him with her career doesn't mean he didn't hit on her either. I think you'd need to walk a mile in an older woman's shoes to understand. ",

				"commentBody": "Fox News is a brand- not a factual statement or description of what goes on under the guise of a news channel and the brand stands for nothing other than Republican propaganda: disinformation, innuendo, half-truths, outright lies and talking points from the RNC. Much of the debasement of television news in America can be traced to Roger Ailes and his GOP TV Channel.<br/><br/>A study showed that loyal Fox viewers scored lower on a series of questions about current events than people who watched or read from any other outlet. Even people who watched no TV news and listened to no radio news scored higher. Here is the report in PDF for anyone who wished to read it.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/dec10/Misinformation_Dec10_rpt.pdf\" title=\"http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/dec10/Misinformation_Dec10_rpt.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/dec10/Misinformation_Dec10_rp...</a><br/><br/>This is Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch's gift to America.",

For example, most Fox News watchers said at the time (2010) that the economy was getting worse and that Obamacare would increase the deficits. Citing government studies, the report tracked those as not true.  But Fox News watchers were not misled by those studies.  Similarly, the MSNBC watchers were more likely to believe the Us Chamber was financing Republicans over Dimocrats, which was not true.  The study is hopelessly flawed, but to the extent it stands for anything, it stands for the proposition that voters select their media to confirm their own political viewpoint. Can anyone say The New York Times is unbiased?",

An example of why this study is too old to cite:<br/><br/>In 2010, Fox viewers were cited as misinformed because a majority believed that the economy is getting worse. <br/><br/>In hindsight, it appears they were not misinformed. <br/><br/>Applying data about the 2010 election issues to knowledge about current election issues (and the study was about 2010 election issues, not current events), is you engaging in being misleading. You may as well cite a study that says that most people have a chamber pot under their beds, because at one point in time, it was true. ",
