				"commentBody": "While most students from Babson will pursue business careers, it is far from the case that most will choose to maximize career earnings. Most of my ivy league friends went on to investment banking in the 2000s, yet I (as a Babson grad) chose to pursue a career in public education and went on to a PhD program at Columbia. While I agree that it is a dangerous trend to pursue money over, say, learning, I wouldn't belittle Babson for being Money's most visible rep for its rankings. It's highly rigorous liberal arts program is what taught me to be different from other business people and what led me to believing that I can use my skills for the greater good. Babson teaches students to think independently and entrepreneurially, and students have both been highly successful in business and elsewhere with those mindsets. And while I would love for those who do not know what Babson represents to learn more about the school other than just saying \"Oh It's a business school,\" I realize that people will often speak in stereotypes rather than learning the truth in discourse.",

You improve public education in part by standardizing and elevating its quality through MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses) moderated by our best educators, cutting countless less-gifted teachers out of the loop. Basic research certainly can be performed anywhere, and, in time, much of it can be automated. Healthcare and food distribution as well can be automated to a far greater degree than at present, and it's getting there. Housing? Robots again.<br/><br/>I can't imagine that any likely solution to the challenges I've outlined will involve LESS spending and government; but your response fails to erect a single barrier to my reasoning.",

Trump plays that card very well, constantly appealing to fears of invasion from Mexico and the Middle East.   Fears of a government said to be corrupt and inept, of leaders he and other Republicans say have failed, like that Kenyan Barack Obama.   <br/><br/>Americans like their leaders bold and their leadership bolder, regardless of how ludicrous or dangerous the ideas or the actions.   Many like the man or woman who speaks their language, as with G.W. Bush, a man they'd like to have a beer with.   <br/><br/>Bill Maher has said over and over that Americans are stupid, P. T. Barnum said a 'sucker is born every minute', and the great huckster of our times, 'delicious' or not, is capturing the imagination  ... or should we say for far too many, our lack of it.",

This is just one of many columns demeaning Mr. Obama that have been a constant theme of the WSJ. The only difference between them  and Limbaugh slander, is they are written by people with a better English education.<br/><br/>Frequently I hear people who are right wing oriented. Their comment on how the country is being run is composed of this slander promulgated by the conservatives.<br/><br/>By the way, just what is a conservative?

My first got turned down at Amherst while daughter 2 was feted there as well as at several Ivies, one of which she graduated from. Both equally succeeded, one in medicine and one as a budget analyst, and both are highly successful in their professions. Perhaps universities should look at recommendations as well as face to face interviews to gain insight. Weigh these as importantly as test scores.

These reporters are only following orders, yes they are smart and well informed but they are not in charge of programming. Sanders is largely being ignored. He is a direct challenge to the networks. Just about every pundit they bring on is a Hillary supporter or from the Washington Post. They play what literally is a Hillary advertisement all day long. It's called one dimensional journalism. Hardly ever is there a rebuttal by the Sanders supporters. Time Warner is a major contributor to Mrs Cliinton's campaign. Jeesh, follow the money.",
