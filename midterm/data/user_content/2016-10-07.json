				"commentBody": "My wife and I lived in Rockledge, Florida, slightly north of Melbourne, in Brevard County, up until few years ago. If we had been there, on Thurloe Drive (where our home used to be), we'd be under evacuation orders (Zone 5). We were always well prepared because we have lived in every disaster area you can think of: earthquakes and brush fires (Norther and Southern California) ; tornadoes and blizzards (Iowa, and my wife was also in Kansas) and then of course flooding and hurricanes (Florida, and now in Texas). <br/><br/>Heed the warnings...they are not a joke. Once my wife, in a mild storm, drove across a flooded street in Iowa that only had three inches of rain, but that was enough to make her car skid seriously. Once on our way to Minnesota, the weather was warm $ sunny when we started, we ran right into a blizzard. We, who follow weather information closely, forgot that day to listen to the Minnesota weather station in the car. Believe us, weather can go from normal and manageable to serious and severe in twenty minutes. This is true for hurricanes too. Until the fat lady sings you don't know if hurricane's eye is going to come right over your town or 60 miles away. Do not take the warnings lightly.<br/><br/>We always kept emergency supplies packed and ready 24/7. We also kept a box of blankets, jackets, some dried clothes, water, dried food, protein shakes flashlight, radio, batteries and a first aid kit in the car, so we can get going at short notice. Do that!",

Once in a serious storm at night, I tried to make a u-turn in a church parking lot. I hit a deep puddle and, because of how the serpentine belt is oriented in my car, it got wet, slipped, and I lost power steering. It was only momentary, but deeply unsettling how quickly I went from just fine to uh-oh! Of course it's no tragedy to lose power steering, but unless you've been driving a classic car, you forget how much effort it takes to maneuver a car without it. I essentially lost control of the car, in the dark, with no clue about how much deeper the water could be.  I can only imagine multiplying my panic however-many-fold in a real flood or hurricane, etc.",

A substantial part of medical education is scientifically based but ethics, legal matters, psycho-social issues and practice management are also part of the training. Lack of any \"brain dead social science\" knowledge among physicians is a detriment that would hurt the patient but also the bottom line.<br/><br/>It also appears that you do not understand the distinction between academics like psychologists and physicians like psychiatrists. Perhaps you should take a look at the textbook of the 2000 (year) Nobel Prize winner in Medicine, psychiatrist Dr. Eric Kandel, titled \"Principles of Neural Science.\" Let's see how many pages an engineer can get through of this book for psychiatrists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, pathologists, geneticists and other neuroscientists.

The department pretty much fell all over me when I went to interview, I had the impression that having a pulse was the primary requirement, they were so desperate.   I got into Internal Medicine easily, but then I graduated with my med school's major prize in Internal Medicine, along with graduating first in my large class?  And am still NIH-funded 25 years later.<br/><br/>Maybe it's different now?  But are General Surgery residencies all that competitive?  Who wants to do Cardiac Surgery these days?  Versus say Opthalmology or Derm?  Or for that matter, Internal Medicine residencies at my hospital, where many are MD PhDs from Stanford/Yale/Harvard/Wash U/UTSW/Penn, attracted by the research strength of my hospital?  And, of course, by our Cards and Oncology programs....",

When your patient cannot communicate well with you and consent has to be given by a parent/ guardian, not to speak of parents and guardians who don't take responsibility for their child, things can get very complicated, very quickly.

Even the smartest and most successful surgeons, presumably at the top income rungs in medicine, make relatively little compared to equally smart and successful lawyers, bankers and such. Medicine used to attract the best and brightest when it paid very well.  Now we get the reasonably smart and fairly motivated.  As the mean incomes of doctors continue to decline, along with the autonomy and prestige of the profession, I suspect we will learn to be happy with medical students who are not entirely stupid and just short of lazy.  Consider even now that a graduate of Harvard Law who finishes in the top 10% of her class and goes to work for a corporate law firm in New York will make more as a first year associate at age 22 than a similar top graduate of Harvard Med who enters internal medicine will at age 40, after an additional half dozen years of training, and a decade of working.  Also, the income of the top doctor will likely never rise above this level, the starting salary of the lawyer.  My patients who are financial advisors note that doctors are not very useful clients as they tend to have hardly any money.  No kidding.",

				"commentBody": "Publication in the National Academy of Sciences is another sad moment for science. There are many flaws in this design across selection bias, exclusion of data, and creation of the key variable. Even if there are significant differences in the few contrived scenarios, this is not likely to be relevant in the real world. The authors minimized the six scenarios where physicians were in agreement - as has the media. The flaws begin with the political categorization. For example in states where one party dominates, those who desire to have voter impact on the primary elections will belong to the dominant party regardless of their political affiliation. Also many do not vote and their political affiliation may have changed (with age or other reasons). The authors have expressed a clear bias that they think that political affiliation shapes patient care decisions. They have stated that physicians do not leave bias behind during visits and they set out to demonstrate this. They clearly have structured their scenarios, their analysis, and their writing this direction. The scenario does not allow the physician to pick up verbal cues, relationships, resources, appearance, or other contributors to decision-making. There are insufficient limitations expressed for such a study.",

But as soon as the stories of him just being a die hard Cubs fan who happened to be in the wrong place at the right time, we collectively let that one go. He wasn't the one that gave up the lead. He wasn't the one that gave up a bunch of runs after that play. Hopefully that weight is lifted off his shoulders this year as well. Poor schlub. ",
