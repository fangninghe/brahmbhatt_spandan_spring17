This hardly is an environmental improvement, but it probably will benefit the plastic bag industry.  I also look forward to carrying bags around with me when I go out to perform multiple tasks, not just shopping.  Lots of fun.  If you want to reduce the use of plastic bags, then ban them and come up with a more environmentally friendly solution.",

				"commentBody": "The fee on the shopping bags is ridiculous. It's not because I don't support such an action in principle (I do), but because it's the sort of toothless policy that de Blasio - hopefully a one-term mayor - is known for.<br/><br/>The fee goes back to the store owners. So it's not a tax. The shopkeeper keeps the $.05. So each storeowner gets to charge us an extra nickel just because. If the fee were a tax that the city used for whatever environmental policy it wished to conduct, it would make infinitely more sense. But de Blasio is about not ticking off anyone (because when he does, he always loses), so instead we pay an extra nickel at the store for no reason whatsoever.<br/><br/>And those on food stamps are exempt from this fee? Why is that? If anyone wants to avoid the five-cent fee, they can bring their own bag to the store, no? Do people on food stamps not have their own bags? they don't have to be the same fancy canvas bags yuppies use. They can bring a plastic bag. Why do we need to nanny the poor? I am all about public assistance of those without means, but this is patronizing nanny state garbage. If the city's intention is for New Yorkers to be more environmentally responsible, such incentives should apply to ALL New Yorkers. You can't tell me people on food stamps don't have a plastic bag of their own laying around the house if they want to avoid the fee.",

And That\u2019s what you feel is worth complaining about? Seriously?!<br/><br/>Look. I\u2019m struggling to make ends meet; very much living paycheque to paycheque, with all kinds of things that I can\u2019t afford to do, as well as bills I have to fork out for. But the notion of picking on those with even less than me \u2013 even though the unemployed here pay such a charge \u2013 well, that would seem to be the definition of being petty and mean-spirited. (I've been jobless before, on a number of occasions, so I totally empathise with those trying to get by in that way.)<br/><br/>I have absolutely no problem with Society \u2013 or hard-working people, like you and I \u2013 paying more to support/help those at the bottom, because that\u2019s what Society is, and how it should function. Otherwise, the mean sniping at those with less who are getting some help, or exemptions, simply reinforces division and inequality, and a sink-or-swim-and-Screw-You mentality.<br/><br/>No \u2018hard working families\u2019 are going to fall apart because they\u2019re paying for a bag, while others don\u2019t.

They scrunch up to almost nothing, and are much stronger than plastic.  I am still using the ones I got years ago.<br/><br/>Even if your current bags get one more use as trash disposal - that is not the point.  The billions of tons of plastic that are floating in the ocean, buried as sediment in landfills, and littering almost every corner of the land are toxic and dangerous.  They break down into microscopic pieces that will last almost forever.<br/><br/>Household food trash doesn't need to be wrapped, we put ours unwrapped in green bins that is then composted.  I am trying mightily to not buy stuff with excess packaging, and in fact make a nuisance of myself by insisting on leaving the packaging with the vendor.  I don't have a good answer yet for dog poop and kitty litter.  In a much less populated environment it would be OK to leave animal excrement where it lies.  That is unrealistic now.<br/><br/>The days of every one of us leaving a trail of nondegradable litter behind each step we take has to come to an end.",

In a world of $5 cappuccinos, how could a 5 cent fee have any effect on people's lives?

				"commentBody": "It's an absolute myth that paper bags are more benign environmentally. Among other things:<br/><br/>1) The paper manufacturing process is highly toxic as well as energy and water intensive, much more so than with plastic. <br/><br/>2) The bags are significantly heavier and therefore require more energy to transport, as well as doing more cumulative damage to roads.<br/><br/>3) They're not as durable as plastic so have less re-use potential. They're also not as \"stuffable\", so are less likely to be carried around.<br/><br/>Not that plastic is harmless, or cloth for the matter, but on balance, disposable paper bags might be the worst. The best you can do is use heavier duty re-usable bags which, contrary to another common myth, are not unsanitary if used smartly. <br/><br/>See more details below.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://ecomyths.org/2014/05/27/myth-paper-bags-are-greener-than-plastic/\" title=\"https://ecomyths.org/2014/05/27/myth-paper-bags-are-greener-than-plastic/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ecomyths.org/2014/05/27/myth-paper-bags-are-greener-than-plastic/</a>",

Many of our grocery stores have such narrow aisles that they prohibit the use of granny-type personal shopping carts.<br/><br/>We HAVE to use bags here, and we can't just keep our canvas bags or our granny-carts in our cars like you do. We can't use paper bags, because you can't carry two paper bags when you're walking home from the grocery store. We need handles.<br/><br/>Grocery shopping is already such a pain in New York that many people have switched to Fresh Direct's online delivery service. So many people have switched that entire grocery chains have shut down in the past year (Food Emporium, Waldbaum's, A&amp;P, Pathmark). The added cost of buying plastic bags (because, really, nobody here is going to carry empty bags in his pocket all day) will make this worse. More local grocery stores will close. Instead of plastic bags in trees, we'll have even more Fresh Direct trucks blocking traffic and spewing fumes all day as they sit double-parked on the avenue.",

				"commentBody": "You can buy a reusable bag for 99 cents at pretty much any grocery store. It's really not a big deal people to bring a few bags with you to the store. As for the \"negative health impact\" of reusable bags -that's grasping at straws. I've use the same bags for years with no negative health consequences - you just wash them out like anything else if they get dirty. Are New Yorkers really that lazy that they can't bring a bag to help save the environment? And if you forget or make an unexpected stop at the store, 5 cents is a pittance. <br/><br/>Honestly though, I don't think anyone, food stamps or otherwise, should be exempt. This is how people learn - by paying a consequence. If you can remember your EBT card and your coupons, you can remember a reusable bag. You don't save the environment by only having some people change their behavior, it needs to be universal. <br/><br/>I also think at least part of the money raised should go to the environment. It shouldn't be a fundraiser for private businesses.",
