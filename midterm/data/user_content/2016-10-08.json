				"commentBody": "I find that our couple centric world has made things more difficult for me as a single woman who never was able to form a lasting relationship with another person.  I very much wanted a husband and children but it was never in the cards try as I might.  However, costs do not go down because you are one and not two.  Going out of town?  Theres no discount for a room with a double bed because there is no one else occupying the room with you.   Then there is the stress of having to make decisions without another person as a sounding board.<br/><br/>I suppose at the end of life I will take my chances but I dont expect it to be pretty. Late in life I asked myself why is it that people get an extra tax deduction for having a child.  Why not a deduction for not having a child.  Dont get me wrong.  I do not resent helping others through my taxes but I really could have used some consideration as I have gone through life bootstrapping it with no breaks at all.",

The career of this man(?) has been one of delivering as little as possible in exchange for taking as much as he can.  I'm totally surprised that someone of your once-apparent intellect can still give him the slightest shred of credence as a potential President.<br/><br/>And, in case you didn't notice in this infamous video, he's all talk, puffing himself up like Aesop's bullfrog with boorish, conceited, vainglorious talk.  I would have added \"adolescent\" except that it would insult adolescents. <br/><br/>It would have been quite revealing if the video had emerged around the time he floated down the Trump Tower escalator to declare his candidacy to a crowd of hired actors.

There is or can be existential suffering in dealing with these issues but can't we elevate the discussion beyond whining, blaming, hand-wringing and a kind of monoculture approach to the topic. There is no more a generic antidote or solution for how \"graying women\" deal with life intimate relationships when they age than there is for grieving. Therein lies part of the problem. Am I to succumb to diease, malaise or loneliness on the one hand or grand dating schemes, braggadocio of the coolly independent, or rave goddam it feels good to be rid of those stupid men. Or shall I carry the chalice of self sufficiency, shout hurrah for book groups and women friends. It feels to me like elements of this article are a wake up call that surrender is not an option. Life with death and illness will happen. There may be a lot of struggle but let's do the best we can, be our best selves, not become a graying robot, bled of our heart and souls because we are being told what to expect, what is best for us, buck up and deal with it. To me this reflects ageism at its worst.  Leave us to choose how we want to live and with whom despite the potential that remaining a single after losing a partner may shorten your life. Life is not an algorithm.",

Why 40% of us think entertainment is going to fix their woes of preserve our values is beyond me, but that's TV and profitable. Profitable for Trump, anyways, and that's what's important, isn't it?<br/><br/>So he thinks the US should entertain itself with juvenile antics and degrading women, not to mention people of other faces, fat people (not including himself, Gingrich, Christie), people of other religions, and victims of destroyed neighborhoods running away from murder, mayhem, and starvation.<br/><br/>But he's a TV personality, an expert in every detail of production values. He knows how to grab your attention.<br/><br/>He knows how to make a profit, and damn the torpedoes if it's somebody else's money, bankruptcy, stiffing contractors, tax shenanigans, it's all good. He's a \"success\" (scare quotes intentional, because in my book he is far from successful). He's good at exploitation and taking advantage of the system.<br/><br/>That makes it odd that people annoyed with \"the system\" think he's going to fix it for them. The fix is in, all right, but the only beneficiary is Trump himself.<br/><br/>But for heaven's sake, let's not have some last minute substitution. None of the Republican possibilities care about us either, so let's just get some good public servants in and give ourselves a shot at a future.<br/><br/>Ruat coelum!",

Even if they say they don't -- over time they resent that they're not the center of things, and that she remains a person doing the things she wants to do, and even putting them first on a regular basis. Because in the end they don't want to share: they want to come first, the men. So the women know that if they're going to do their thing, they're not going to be able to negotiate something reasonable. They just have to go and do it regardless of how the man feels. And that's when many marriages end. <br/><br/>I've been involved with far too many men who wanted a semi-mommy who also made them feel like they were running everything on their own. I'm too old for that crap. If a man's going to make it into my life, he'll need his own money, his own friends, his own work and interests, his own planning for his old age care, and his own self-discipline when it comes to taking care of his health, mental and physical. And also be quite interesting and nice to the people he lives with as a normal way of being, not taking out his moods on them or expecting them to absorb his unhappinesses. I'll let you know if I ever meet such a guy, but after a half-century on the planet, I'm not counting on it.",

You surely had wonderful plans for your \"golden years\" with your spouse. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, our cruel and capricious laws allow for \"no fault divorce\" -- meaning anyone can leave their spouse, for any reason (or no reason). I believe that is morally wrong.<br/><br/>However: human beings have an extraordinary capacity to adapt and survive. You will, too. Thankfully, you are relatively young and in good health. You don't have to worry about caring for your parents (though I am sorry you had to lose them), so your future is reasonably free. You can move -- get new friends -- start new hobbies or a new career.<br/><br/>You might wish to think about this: at 56, you are not remotely too old to adopt an older child, or one with special needs, or become a foster parent. if this was your DREAM, and your ex did not share it....now you can proceed without hindrances. If not that, maybe you can work or volunteer with children.<br/><br/>You have a much better chance at remarrying than you probably realize, if that is your desire.<br/><br/>I wish you the best of luck.",

Unfortunately it's truly as deep and horrifying as his views on the CP5. They are manifestations of hate which are learned, assimilated into the core and then over decades regurgitated repeatedly building a highly detailed and accurate representation of someone who has never had to account for anything.<br/><br/>Both the misoginy and racism are on equal footing and are shameful deformities of human thought. As recent evidence shows this has been handed down to the next generation.",

				"commentBody": "If Trump is forced to drop out, leaving Mike Pence at the top of the ticket, I shudder to think of what will come next. Pence put in a workmanlike performance in the VP debate and appears on the surface to be staid, calm, and more reasonable than Trump.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>Pence's history of anti-LGBT legislation, his support of discredited and horrific \"gay conversion\" therapy, his anti-choice stance, his zeal to cut taxes for the wealthy, his opposition to environmental protections, his climate science denial and his support of teaching creationism as science in public schools, his willingness to champion laws prohibiting local governments to pass progressive ordinances on their own (minimum wage, parental leave, etc.) that aren't also mandated at the state level -- those are what I worry about.<br/><br/>Maybe we should stop being appalled by the dog and pony show that's Donald J. Trump, and start thinking about what having Mike Pence in the White House might mean.",
