				"commentBody": "I have a couple of cousins who drank Coke for breakfast as kids (in South Carolina), and struggled with their weight all their lives. The heavier one now has Alzheimer's; the other, now retired, went through yo-yo dieting and a Diet Coke habit for years. She looked great when she was slender, but it never lasted more than a few weeks. The older one was a school principal, the younger a vice president of a major retail chain--no dummies. I'm no sylph myself, and with age I've gained weight, but I've become very aware of sugar and nutrition and fake food that should be avoided. We know a lot more now than we did in the heyday of junk food.",

				"commentBody": "Another thought is that without careful analysis in the literature, impression has strong headline bias and size-of-the-state-economy bias.  In that case, there are two points: 1) most of the data are ignored, 2) the data that are not ignored are explained by the headline story du jour.   The notion that this rationale underlies some significant portion of the data is absent from the thinking at this point.<br/><br/>Write the paper and help us get on the right track.",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>.<br/>Deb, you inquired about the new format? I think it looks like a million bucks -- or should I say 2.098 million bucks? I'm not talking DEER either. It's spiffy right down to the photo caption.<br/><br/>But I'm not sure a newbie would understand what is meant by \"symmetrical black squares\" (a square has multiple symmetries including mirror, rotational, and perhaps even radial) nor by \"revealer\".<br/><br/>I could be wrong. When I started lurking here, I allowed some time to pass between asking for definitions of terms such as \"chewy\", \"crunchy\", and \"Scrabbly\". (And to be honest, hundreds of crosswords later, I am still in a muddle about why it's a good thing to use \"Scrabbly\" letters? They have point values in Scrabble, but in books or crosswords or variety puzzles, JLO could be FLO or SLO and none would be the less for it. Not that I've noticed, anyway.)<br/><br/>If they're going to tinker with the blog page, how about putting a smallish jpg of the completed grid at the bottom of the page where all the empty space is? Some newbies may not like flipping back to their solution to see what the blog is talking about.<br/><br/>If not, the bottom part of the blog page could be used for the Comment section. The \"Recommended for You\" links down there are annoying.<br/><br/>Speaking of the completed grid, the app helpfully enters ACE in each appropriate place after the grid is filled correctly. I thought that was a nice touch -- 59% nicer than solution grids a year ago.",

Do you now how much data it costs to load all of that extra rarely-viewed material? And when the server/net is slow, it hoses half way through the load. I know  that is the new economic model for charging more for data for the telecom's (some websites get a kickback for designing this way!) but does NYT have to go along?

It started with the too small stimulus.  <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/larry-and-the-invisibles/\" title=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/larry-and-the-invisibles/\" target=\"_blank\">http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/larry-and-the-invisibles/</a>  If the economic quagmire was just the result of Republican obstructionism, then Obama has managed to keep this a secret from the American people for 7 going on 8 years.  Does anyone believe Obama is a poor communicator, who has trouble articulating his thoughts and ideas?  So called liberal economists may like to defend the Obama administration all they like, but they wouldn't have to if the economy was really good, or Obama chose to defend it himself, convincingly.  He can't because it isn't, because he's been off target consistently, about the stimulus size, tax cuts,  debt ceiling negotiations, sequestration, pursing a grand bargain, the price of inequality.<br/>\"It could have been worse.\" is not a winning slogan, and neither is \"Eight more years of gridlock is the best we can do.\"<br/>That's why Obama won only 51% of the vote despite being the incumbent despite facing an opponent's deeply flawed campaign.

He sure hasn't issued any policy papers, and though I haven't looked for any, I doubt he's written any substantial editorials. So, in terms of, you know, being an active member of any government, we've had an almost zero shot at hearing any coherent plans or policies. Hillary and Bernie both have substantial track records.

Get a bunch of one-liners and call them your policy; like, build a wall and Mexico will pay, do away with common core, bring back jobs, deport illegals, etc.  Next, be outrageous, rude, crude and unpredictable - the public will love it. Then, develop a base of uneducated people who believe whatever misfortune they experience is the government's fault. Proclaim you are highly educated, smart and rich and have the experience to fix it all. To get rid of rivals, identify what they value and ridicule it. For Cruz it was the Bible and his Father. This will cause your opponent to loose it, then say, he started it. These are tactics of bullies and work well as long as you are in a crowd of friendlies. However, Trumps strength is his weakness. He got upset about small hands and he will get upset if somebody nails him on his business successes. He is banking on the fact that the Press know he is great for ratings and won't seriously confront him. You will know if you are getting to him as he will threaten to sue, we have seen it before. If we are unfortunate enough to see him elected, I am sure we will hear him say, I will fix it, but I won't tell you how - trust me, I'm smart, He will then have a surrogate implement something and if it fails, he will fire him with glee. The apprentice all over again. The bottom line is, are we prepared to have a con-artist as President or are we putting someone in office to destroy government.",
