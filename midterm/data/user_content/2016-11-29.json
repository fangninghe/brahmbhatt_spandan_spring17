In his too vivid imagination, it's impossible, literally impossible that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton.   And to lose to a 'woman', it's unthinkable in his universe.<br/><br/>Meanwhile his minions spin tall tales, like Bill O' Reilly tonight issuing the proclamation that it could have happened just this way, that Bill's research team - one of the finest! - went to California and found out just how easy it is easy for 'illegals' to become registered and to vote.   It was easy to imagine Bill with his imaginary Ben Franklin glasses, peering deeply into the faces of his television audience.   The lie must be kept alive!<br/><br/>Meanwhile on planet earth, our president elect has been unremittingly the butt of more jokes than likely any president elect in American history, not only here but around the world.   <br/><br/>We await a deluge of Pinocchio cartoons, interposed with The Donald's face.   With his massively inflated egoistic head, now barely able to pass through normal doorways, Don will have to go into rooms now always face first, as his nose will preclude him from entering any other way.",

				"commentBody": "Sanctuary is a meaningless term and it is not the job of cities to proactively seek out those here illegally. That said, many of us in the northwest despise the perversion of language that attempts to conflate legal with illegal immigration. Those who made decisions to come illegally do not earn my sympathy or respect. Their minor children do and perhaps might be allowed to stay if they are 'dreamers' while sending their parents back, as most of these are at an age of self-sufficiency.<br/>And most perversely, we insult the great country of Mexico, with 122 million people, with education, opportunity and economic growth and diversity. Suggesting that one can't be happy or successful there is non-sensical and chauvinistic. Sure there are bad spots there and tough circumstances, but likewise many places in the US are desperate.<br/>We must enforce our laws, and change immigration criteria to one based upon admitting those who are contributors. No more family preferences for adult siblings, elderly parents, cousins and the like. And let's put an end to birthright citizenship, which is something perhaps 30 countries including the US offer. One should not be able to show up as a tourist or a non-resident, deliver a child who is conferred this precious benefit. My grandson was born in South Africa while his parents were working there and had no such right. I did not vote for him, but this is a position of his that I and many other 'liberals, including Times readers, heartily support. ",

				"commentBody": "The larger point that needs to be made about this recount is that the professionals who initially brought their concerns to the Clinton campaign, which chose NOT to act on those concerns until the Stein campaign forced the issue, were apparently alarmed that Hillary's vote in several swing states was roughly 7% less than expected in districts where voting machines that lacked a paper trail were used.  This could be nothing more than coincidence. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is no way to recount a vote cast in a machine that produces no paper trail.  The simple fact that so many machines lack that trail creates a plausible reason for doubt in the validity of the process.  <br/><br/>Perhaps in 2002 and 2003 no one could imagine Russian or Chinese agents attempting to manipulate an American election; but in 2016, we can readily imagine such a thing.  <br/><br/>If a paper trail existed, all reasonable suspicions could be dispelled; but without that paper trail, suspicion is inevitable and perhaps even warranted.",

The polls were wrong and you guys drank the pollsters' KoolAid.  Nor did any election expert predict that Russia would hack the Clinton campaign and the DNC, reason enough for the USG to go on alert against Russian hacking of the ballot. <br/><br/>The virtue of having a recount far outweighs the likelihood (there are no absolute certainties here) that recounts will not alter the results in any of the three states.  Recounts will restore voter confidence, now shaken, that we can rely on the Presidential vote to be counted honestly.  <br/><br/>Trump's big lie about 3 million illegal voters (all Mexican rapists?) apparently is based on white nationalist inventions.  It is speculative but Trump probably said this nonsense in order to distract media attention from 1) his numerous conflicts of interest and 2) the qualifications or lack thereof of his appointments to date.  If so, he succeeded. <br/><br/>The clear and present danger in Trump's remarks is that they signal a Republican drive to disenfranchise in the 2018 electoral cycle large numbers of Hispanics and blacks through well honed techniques of voter suppression, sanctified by a Jeff Sessions Justice Department and, probably, by a Supreme Court made tame by new Trump appointments.

Just because something is legal today doesn't make it right or perceived as legal in the future. It is every person's responsibility in this world to fight against unjust actions. Blanket statements about immigration have no meaning. Each individual case is unique. <br/><br/>People do break laws, and there are penalties for them. People who have been here for a long period and have not broken any other laws could be allowed to stay paying a fine, and paying back taxes if they haven't done so. It is not a big deal.  Deportation is an extreme response IMO. Even when people kill other people, the response isn't always a death penalty. <br/><br/>Besides, I think the US is stronger because of its immigrants, both legal and lapsed/illegal. ",

I am a staunch supporter of a mutualized health care system that guarantees quality health care to every citizen, even those who can't afford it; and my position on abortion is that it's no one's decision to make other than the woman concerned. With regards to the corporate world, I think this country's laws and policies should be shaped in the interest of its people over that of its business lobbies. On many fronts, I side with Liberals, and in some cases, with Socialists.<br/>But with regards to Illegal Immigration, I believe common sense dictates that no wide-ranging social advancement is sustainable if it's open to abuse by unlimited numbers of Illegal Aliens. Furthermore, the Middle Class needs to be re-empowered; and drowning the job market with Illegals and bogus HB visas runs counter to any improvement in the Middle Class's fate.<br/>The current refusal to enforce laws, and to simply regulate immigration, serves to alienate further the weakest and poorest among our own underclass: namely Blacks to a large extent, and lower-class Whites. The same ones Liberals, and incidentally Social Justice Warrior mayors of sanctuary cities pretend to care about.<br/><br/>I hate that homeless shelters, the elderly, and children would have to suffer from the lack of funds should a backlash occur, but if that's what it takes to expose the hypocrisy of \"sanctuary cities\" and force those responsible to set their priorities straight, so be it.",
