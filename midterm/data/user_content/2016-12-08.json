Reagan was pilloried every day by liberals who were adamantly against everything he believed and sought to do. Yet Reagan turned enough people, even when he DIDN'T have a supportive Congress, and largely DID was he said he was going to do. <br/><br/>We make altogether too many excuses for a president who failed to do the same thing, despite the fact that many disagreed with his aims for America. At the end of HIS eight years, Reagan had hard-hat, life-long Democrats screaming \"Four more years!\" Whether Trump succeeds or not at duplicating that feet, it's quite clear that Barack Obama didn't -- it was those same hard-hats who elected Trump.",

States, cities and businesses can take the lead. They are more accessible to their citizens than is the federal government, so your input and efforts can count. <br/><br/>Also, cities are fighting climate change on an international level. Check out the work of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group which represents 8o of the world's major cities and works hand in hand with the Paris Climate Accord nations. Check it out and join in. <br/><br/>As the U.S. Government moves backwards, the rest of the world, including U.S. citizens, can fight for a sustainable future. ",

				"commentBody": "Welcome to Oklahoma! Under Trump, America will become just as poor and poorly governed as the flat--out-broke state of Oklahoma.<br/>In Oklahoma the oil companies are god. The state government ties themselves in knots to accommodate big oil. Here is how the oil companies thank the state. After every boom ends, and they always end, the oil companies move on leaving the state poor and with torn up roads due to the weight of oil trucks, with empty hospitals which were built to take care of the many oil field accidents, and with unemployed oil field workers who aren't trained to do anything else. Many of them look for work after having their hands crushed or fingers torn off.<br/>I've lived here off and on for almost my entire life. There were never earthquakes before fracking. Now there are earthquakes every day. Oil companies aren't paying for the big cracks in people's tornado shelters. They're not paying for the brick siding that falls off people's houses. Oil companies claim fracking doesn't cause earthquakes and Pruitt goes along with them. Fracking doesn't pay anymore so the oil companies have moved on, but the earthquakes continue. After a 5.6 earthquake in November, the town of Cushing is suing energy companies for all the damage. If Pruitt has his way, Cushing will be out of luck because the oil companies will never pay.<br/>If you want to be left high and dry, like Oklahoma is over and over, go ahead and support Trump and Pruitt. Industry will suck us dry.",

What were they thinking?<br/>That is one of my greatest fears, that the people will be stripped of their right to sue for the damage done by these companies. My town in Massachusetts recently won a $30 million settlement against Exxon/Mobil whose leaking gasoline tanks resulted in the contamination of 100's of residential wells, commercial wells and our four schools, town offices, library, a nursing home/ assisted living facility as well as a senior housing complex and several small restaurants. The settlement will pay for a public water system negotiated with a neighboring town. We are now suing a waste management facility that has poisoned well water in a different, very rural part of town. It is prohibitively expensive to have a public water facility since our town is one of the largest in land mass in Worcester County with low population density of 305 per square mile. Massachusetts as a state has a population density of 858. The residential water pipe cost on average is $25K. Some people own 500 feet of frontage. The pipe for these households would be around $80K! Some houses are miles apart.  Who should pay? The people or the polluters? Or do we just continue to drink toxic, cancer causing water until we die?<br/>How ALL of us don't find the possible elimination of the EPA terrifying is beyond comprehension.",

Usually the candidate who wins the popular vote also wins the EC.  Hillary also has the largest popular vote lead of any losing candidate in history. The last person to lose the election but win the most votes was Al Gore, who won 543,000 more votes than George W. Bush. Before that, Benjamin Harrison lost with a lead of 90,000, Samuel Tilden lost with a lead of 250,000, and Andrew Jackson lost with a lead of 38,000.<br/>Let's see what happens in six months--sure!  My guess is that the president elect will be lining his pockets, that the environment will suffer.  And I'll also add, I do not appreciate his play against Boeing regarding a new Air Force One.  If that new plane is not built, the next President will inherit a plane that is 35 years old.  T and his grandstanding is repugnant to me and there is nothing you can write to change my mind.  He's the crooked one even though he maligned Hillary with that epithet. ",

Natural gas is currently the cheapest form of energy, and it prevents bird-killing wing energy and arsenic-based solar from being competitive without subsidies. The largest single donor of 2014 was A GREEN ENERGY investor named Thomas Steyer, whom most liberals have never heard of because Democrats don't want to advertise the fact that he donated over $70 million to their campaign in 2014, compared to the Koch Brother's paltry $7 million to the GOP. The party of the rich needs to outspend by large margins to get their responsibility-hating voters to the polls, so they will do what they need to keep their donors rich and their campaign coffers full: destroy the competition of small-cap green energy so it can multiply in value and make those investors far wealthier than Trump, all while pretending to care about the environment.",

				"commentBody": "This is easily the most depressing thing to come out of this depressing election.  Science taught us common sense sense was often wrong: the earth doesn't sit, statically, on a pile of turtles, the stars aren't holes in a felt sky, and it certainly isn't flat.  There was a lot of \"common-sense\" resistance to that whatever, 800 years ago or so.<br/><br/>You'd think we'd have learned not to trust \"common sense\", but there were many appeals to it over the past months.  And claims that a cabal of scientists conjured up the idea of Global Warming to garner grant money.  No acknowledgement of the hard work of thousands of dedicated people who THINK for a living, people whose methodology brought us the steam engine (it may look simple, but please describe for me the Rankine cycle, and how you might make a steam engine more efficient), radio transmission (please describe for me Maxwell's Equations, with particular emphasis on the presence of the constant c and its implications), vaccines (you anti-vaxers out there: explain how an Fab paratope binds to a foreign epitope, thereby exciting production of antibodies) brought to us by an understanding gained by stunningly ingenious experiments.  You who dismiss the idea of earth as a greenhouse because there is no glass shell around us, please tell me what you know of the vibrational modes of a CO2 molecule  At what wavelength of light are those modes excited?  What happens when they decay? Explain the C13/C12 ratio in the atmosphere?  Idiots.",
