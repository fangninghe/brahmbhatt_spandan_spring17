				"commentBody": "Conceding Trump is a thin-skinned, impulsive, thoughtless person.<br/><br/>In my opinion, even if you have a military background or even if your own son died serving in the military, *ideas you espouse* are not any less subject to refutation nor should your political positions be granted any greater deference than another man's ideas. <br/><br/>In more crass terms, just because Mr. Khan lost his son doesn't render his ideas and viewpoints, way of life, religious practices or political speech on network television immune from criticism and refutation.<br/><br/>Granted, Trump is acting tone deaf here, I do find this whole controversy illogical from that perspective.  Actually more than that--when the shoe is on the other foot and it's a GOP ex-military guy espousing some Trumpian borderline racism, I feel like the media doesn't grant that speaker the same deference.  It smells like an agenda-driven story.",

Many people of his generation did the same. It's not even his contempt for the people who served. He wouldn't be the first baby boomer to spit on returning American soldiers. . . not even the first to spit on American war dead, sadly. But he IS the first Presidential nominee from a major U.S. political party to do so for (what he crassly and wrongly thought was) political gain. <br/><br/>Who would do such a thing? Who would do it, and then do it *again*? And again? And again? <br/><br/>Dr. Khan was exactly right about this. . . person. He doesn't deserve a single American vote for *anything*, let alone the Presidency of the United States of America. ",
