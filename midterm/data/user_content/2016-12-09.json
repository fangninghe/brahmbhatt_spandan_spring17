To prohibit consumption of a good that is legal in this country, and creating an agency legislated prohibition, is not only an overreach but it is insulting for those who have no other option for housing.  If Congress is of opinion that tobacco consumption is legal, a federal agency should not try to override it in its zeal for public health. ",

Considering smoking isn't permitted inside most buildings, public or private, I fail to see how this is an overreach. I have friends who smoke and rent from landlords who don't allow it in their buildings. They simply smoke outside. They're fine with it, and best of all it prevents their neighbors being harmed by secondhand smoke.",

				"commentBody": "Occam's Razor suggests instead that the Housing Crash was the result of the preceding Housing Bubble, which was most outlandish in the heavily Hispanic four Sand States of California, Arizona, Nevada, and Florida. <br/><br/>George W. Bush promoted lax lending to Hispanics, whom his campaign strategist Karl Rove saw as \"natural conservatives.\" At Bush's October 15, 2002 White House Conference on Increasing Minority Homeownership, the President told federal mortgage regulators that traditional credit standards concerning down payments and income documentation were standing in the way of racial equality in home ownership. Bush's campaign against prudence in lending as discriminatory was quickly echoed by aggressive mortgage men such as Angelo Mozilo of Countrywide.<br/><br/>Home prices surged in California and the other Sand States, luring in more immigrants as construction workers and Spanish language mortgage brokers, only to plummet in 2007-2008 when it became obvious that recent buyers couldn't afford the massive mortgage obligations they had taken on, nor were there deep pocketed buyers who wished to move to rapidly Hispanicizing neighborhoods.

				"commentBody": "Removing minimum wage work would definitely depress wages for some people. The reasons are multiple:<br/> -- that no matter how much they work some are not going to be as efficient or effective as others.  Because of many aspects; they are not as strong, as intelligent, etc.<br/> -- There still exists gender, race, disability, etc. discrimination.<br/> -- that they live in an area with a lot of labor competition, creasing a large pool of laborers who are dependent on jobs accessed through a limited social network or community.<br/> -- that laborers have to find jobs whether they have previously worked in a higher paying job or not; e.g. unemployed coal miners now have to seek minimum wage jobs.  Of course they are going to have to take what they can get.  Even if it is below minimum wage.<br/> -- that if the minimum wage was abolished, along with the cutbacks on other social services that are expected in the administration (including mental health care and substance use treatment), we expect that there will be a correlated increase in job seeking.<br/> -- If trump does in fact proceed with his pushing undocumented immigrants out of the country, we should expect them to become an easily exploited, easily oppressed labor pool which acts as leverage to further split and fragment organized and non-organized labor.  While immigrants are exploited and pushed underground, American low income workers can be marginalized.  ",
