Every morning when he came to work he pulled a little key out of his vest pocket, open a drawer, peered inside, locked the drawer and started work. One morning he didn't show up for work. His boss went to his house and found that he was dead but that he had dressed for work. The boss reached into the vest pocket and pulled out the key. Back at the office, everyone stood around expectantly because -- finally -- the mystery would be solved. When the boss opened the drawer inside he found a single piece of paper that said, \"Debits on the left, credits on the right.\" You're welcome.",

				"commentBody": "@futbolista: you put in quotes, \"the best league in the world,\" referring to the English Premier League. Can you find the link for such a (wrong) claim? It's nowhere in this article, and it's nowhere in any of my comments. So who's saying it and putting a burr under your saddle?<br/>What the English Premier League IS, is the richest league in the world, and one with a sustainable revenue distribution system. It's been about 7 years since Portsmouth went into administration due to fiscal mismanagement in England. Meanwhile, La Liga saw a team relegated for failure to pay its players LAST YEAR.<br/>Every year, each EPL team nets $8 million per year from the sale of the media rights to Comcast-NBCSN, for broadcast here in 'Murica alone. That's a sum that approximates what some of the La Liga minnows get in total media rights, and the American market doesn't take into account Asian rights, African rights, European rights, and the \u00a3 billion in domestic UK rights.<br/>It accounts for the steady flow of Bundesliga players into England, and the relative parity in the league. In Germany, there are 4 teams with +10 GD or better, out of 18. In Spain, it's five out of 20. In England, the number is 8 of 20.",

I had assumed that he would go after the infant if it was a boy, but hadn't guessed that he would kill his father also.  I think most people had already figured out how Jon Snow would be resurrected.  Not much surprise there, but glad they got it over with so that storyline can move on.  At this point, I'm most intrigued by finding out why Hodor stopped speaking. That may not be what the show runners had intended.",

That in that type of fundamentally flawed system, it's this type of person who who end up on top.

Melisandre is not actually a fraud - we know that she created a shadow demon who killed Renly in front of Brienne, we know that she has shapeshifter qualities herself (old lady? not?) - what she said in this episode was that all her predictions for Stannis - huge victory in battle, taking the Iron Throne - were lies, but not that she was unaware of the lies. She does seem to be working on behalf of the true heir to the Iron throne, hence her work to rid the world of Renly and Stannis and Stannis' daughter. We can only wonder at what she will do the House of Lannister. Having revived Jon Snow - as we always knew she would - we can surmise that he is vital to her plan, but who is he really? As for Snow - there are parallels to Christianity, in that the persecuted leader put to death for doing good for many has now been resurrected. If the plot follows that parallel, then Snow cannot stay at the Wall - like the prophet, the resurrected are not accepted at home - he will have to leave the Wall. Home - the title of the episode - turned up a lot - destruction of family members at the Boltons' and the Greyjoys' just as Ramsay turns for home, the Lannisters' plots to save home from the Sparrows.

Dinlkage's centrality in the evolving story dictates that hee won't be meeting his end anytime soon.<br/><br/>As for Jaime and Cersei and the Red Keep Lannisters, I predict the lot of them will be spending several episodes - to no successful end - rearranging their deck chairs on the Titanic/Iron Throne.
