				"commentBody": "\"No, it isn't typical of most employer plans that you have to pay your deductible in full before insurance kicks in.\"<br/><br/>I don't know where you work -- but this is exactly the only health insurance  choice, at the large corporation I work for.  The one and only choice, for my family, is a plan that requires me to pay just under $600 a month with a $4,900 deductible.  And, except for routine checkups (allegedly), this $4,900 dollars has to be paid in full, by me, before the health insurance starts finding ways to \"legally\" weasel out of paying one red cent.  (And I say \"allegedly\" on the \"free\" checkups because they've never actually paid for any checkup.)  And even if they do pay one red cent, it's after they \"claim\" that the health costs were too high (not a \"customary\" charge) and cut them down to about 25% of what was actually charged so I have to pay the \"overcharge\", and then they expect me to pay 20% of the 25% of what they actually did pay (if they don't find some other way to weasel out of that too).  How do they know what \"customary\" charges should be?  UnitedHealthcare owns the corporation that decides what \"customary\" charges should be.  So a health insurance corporation decides what's a fair amount for health insurance corporations to pay the doctors, hospitals and clinics.  And, surprise, surprise, it's always much lower than what you were really charged!  Who would have figured, that would happen when the foxes guard the henhouse?   ",

It's hard to imagine that the good doctor's supporters would  believe he was actually suspending his campaign on the very day that their caucus was taking place (!) but, then again, anyone who would consider voting for him in the first place would conceivably believe just about anything (like the earth being only 5000 years old).  And then, of course, it was Donald Trump who leaped to the Doctor's defense (?) by intimating that Rafael's dirty deed was really all about him, because, after all, any votes withheld from Carson would ultimately be withheld from him (if not from Bush, Kasich, Krispiecreme, et al).  And, somehow or other, it's Marco Rubio, who neither won nor placed, who is determined by the press to have come away with the hearts and minds of Iowans on this day.  You can't make this stuff up.  Not even in America.   ",

Once upon a time, southern schools refused to play black colleges/HBCUs - like Eddie Robinson's Grambling - for fear of losing, or @ worst - get embarrassed. The all white schools had left black collegiate players few options, one of which was to all head to the black colleges/HBCUs, resulting in immense talent all on a few teams.<br/>When traditionally white school started to open doors, that changed. But the old school owners and attitudes, are the ones to blame. If you recall, The Panthers owner once asked Cam to keep a clean cut look, if he drafted him. Imagine that... ",

				"commentBody": "It is unfortunate that Warren Moon came to Canada and that for him these were lost years. Such a terrible, terrible place. The plantation of the North. <br/><br/>It's amazing that he survived. <br/><br/>To my shame, I found myself watching a football game all those years ago, here in Canada, appreciating Mr. Moon's talent. Little did I know how angry he was to come to Canada, forced to make money playing a game.<br/><br/>Subsequently, while playing in the NFL, he signed the biggest contract that any player (black or white) had ever signed, up to that time. I try to imagine the disappointment he must have felt at that moment. <br/><br/>Good to see that the NY Times has used its valuable space to bring this poignant story to the attention of its readers.

I suggest that before you turn 65 you do some serious research.<br/><br/>However, I will say that both Medicare and some Medigap plans also have deductibles. Medicare Part B -- the part that covers doctor expenses -- has an annual deductible of a couple hundred dollars (Part A -- the hospital part of Medicare, has much higher deductibles). Once that Part B deductible is met, Medicare pays 80% of covered expenses. One of the things \"Medigap\" plans typically cover is that 20% that one has to pay out of pocket. However, the Medigap plan I have -- the high deductible version of Medigap Plan F -- only kicks in once I have paid more than $2,000 out of pocket under Medicare. In return I get a much lower premium than I would pay for an unrestricted Plan F. For my first 3 years of coverage under this plan my premium remain unchanged. This year it dropped by $6 a month, i assume because NY is a community-rated state and lower claims experience under this type of plan called for lower premiums.",

Journalism is truly dead if this is the best they can do. ",

Someone does not understand the difference between military intelligence, and diplomatic intelligence, and apparently, that includes ME.<br/>Where I see S.D. emails revealing truly damaging information, is in discussions about how to go about 'secret discussions' with opposition groups, especially if such groups are within supposed allied countries. (e.g., NSA tapping Angela Merkel \u2014 Oops \u2014 that wasn't exposed because of HRC's private server). Any discussion of a strategy about future negotiations with any other country would be part of what, in the case of the S.D. would want classified. I'm probably misstaken, but I would not expect the CIA to inform the S.D. is any diplomats are aslo CIA handlers, never mind who the actual agents are?",
