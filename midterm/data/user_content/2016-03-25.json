But there is no excuse from the Arizona Election Commission for their incompetence in this. Cutting polling from 200 to 60 is an outrage.

If you register as an Independent, you do NOT receive a ballot in \"presidential preference\" primaries unless you go through additional ridiculous processes to change your registration to R or D in time to receive an R or D ballot. MANY MANY registered Independents showed up at polling places in AZ to be told they were NOT eligible to vote. Since many independents are Sanders supporters, he lost thousands of votes in AZ.  I signed up for absentee ballots after almost being disenfranchised the second time I went to vote after moving to AZ in 2004. I had NOT been notified that my polling place had changed AND when I found the new polling place, they could not find my name on the list until I threw a total hissy fit. Despite being on the permanent mailing list, I call the voting registrar's office before EVERY election to make sure I am receiving the ballot and then call to be sure my signature was verified so my mailed-in vote was counted. There is NO REASON to trust voting in AZ no matter what county you reside in. The state is out to disenfranchise Democrats, independents, minorities, Latinos, and poor neighborhoods. It's corrupt and fighting to stay that way.",

				"commentBody": "Great suggestion.  This really deserves yuuge public and moral outrage for limiting scientific research into cures for human illnesses.  Blackburn and GOPers on this committee are the most ignorant of the ignorant when it comes to leadership, society, science, and progress, as if they were absolutely clueless about why we have such good medical care and advanced biological technology today.  Blackburn needs to hold hearings on the current state of bioscience to fight ignorance, including between her own ears.",
