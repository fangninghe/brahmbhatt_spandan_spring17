				"commentBody": "Fair enough Raymond. <br/><br/>I alway revert to tested and proven US model though.<br/><br/>If California has special needs, they issue California debt denominated in USD, as does Mississippi.<br/><br/>So I don't see the need for multiple currencies.<br/><br/>I think you and I are trying to address the same thing: stimulating one region and moderating another due to relative performance.<br/><br/>A common currency is not an impediment given flexible member-state budgets, missing in the formation of the European Union. <br/><br/>In fact, they did the opposite: rigid member-state budgets with penalties for failures. <br/><br/>This puts member-state economies in straight-jackets: Greece was only able to deflate prices in a crisis in order to revive the economy, increasing the value of indebtedness. <br/><br/>With Brexit, optimal time for the EU to launch their own self-financed Marshall plan. <br/><br/>Take all the debt purchased by ECB and replaced with euros and transform it to Eurobonds backed by the ECB. <br/><br/>Banks need HQLA for Basel III.<br/><br/>This permanently reduces debt service costs for any monetary policy. <br/><br/>It de-risks banks and works by leaving all member-states with 10% of former sovereign debt to finance out of direct member-state taxation. <br/><br/>This provides money to address 20%+ unemployment and other structural impediments to growth and prosperity.<br/><br/>Imagine all the money spent freely on war during Europe's history.<br/><br/>Compare that to the imaginary cost of transforming debt held by the ECB already when deflation is the concern de jour.

				"commentBody": "The human mind seeks what I call, \"definitions of reality\".  (I'm putting on my philosopher hat).  The mind seeks stability, that is, it tries to create a reference framework which reduces anxiety.  Without that baseline reference, we are unable to distinguish reality from fantasy.  This is necessary because we are capable fantasizing.  Not being able to make this distinction creates enormous anxiety, which the mind seeks to avoid.  It's like mental pain.<br/><br/>This is a natural response to the problem of consciousness, of self awareness.  Much of what we are aware of is unexplainable.  We then manufacture these definitions which is done in response to the need to reduce anxiety.<br/><br/>That's where miracles come from.  That's where the universal human need for religion comes from.  Even to say that there is no reason for these occurrences, that they are purely random events, is an anxiety reducing mechanism.  <br/><br/>So that's it.  The miracle response happens to make us feel better.  How we get form here to there is where religion and science occupy the same space.     ",

Those players ought to be suspended from the game. Secondly, another disgusting act is for the NFL owners to continue ignoring scientific evidence that hard-hits to the head frequently cause concussions with debilitating brain damage. It is truly pathetic for the NFL commissioner to receive a monstrous salary and owners to become extremely rich - when older players are poor and incapacitated due to brain injuries from their many years of playing football. Hopefully we will see the end of football within our generation.    ",

EVERY CASE is preventable!  <br/><br/>Just as many intravenous drug users are not concerned primarily about lowering their risk of infection with bloodborne pathogens, they are not likely to maintain their habit merely because someone gives them a clean needle. I have never heard of a habit prolonged due to a clean needle. The drive to use heroin is so strong that they will use it whether the needle available to them is used or new.  And dirty needles are available. <br/><br/>HIV is a chronic disease and many people still die from it; I have known dozens of people who have lost their lives to AIDS. Children are still born with HIV. Treating it is not a trivial matter, and less than 1/3 of all US patents are treated adequately. The balance of evidence -- ethically, financially, and logically -- clearly and convincingly calls for an expansion of needle exchange programs. To do otherwise is to be working on the wrong side -- the side of HIV and AIDS -- in our battle with this killer virus.  ",
