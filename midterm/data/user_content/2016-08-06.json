By working so hard to stop Trump from saying things he obviously believe, Republicans are walking down a very muddy road: why do they feel it necessary to ask him to hide his true beliefs? Has honesty disappeared so completely that this remarkable petition, to ask him to appear to be someone he is not, is made without comment?",

				"commentBody": "Nick Corasaniti's article is an account of one of the most tumultuous episodes of the Trump candidacy.  We do indeed close out this week, waiting for the surprises in the next.<br/><br/>We are witnessing the collapse of a political party.  Trump is the latest fault. This party controls congress, but we can't forget that it took them several failures to find a Speaker of the House.  And as for the Senate, Mitch McConnell had to fend off attacks from the Tea Party.  The failure of the George W. Bush presidency left Republicans without leadership, at which point Donald Trump could enter.<br/><br/>Right now, this nation is a one-party show.  This latest act in Green Bay twists the plot once again.  Next year is going to be a very unsettled one for Republicans.  The question is, will this nation be able to accomplish anything with a disrupted Republican party?<br/><br/>RNC officials might fret over the condition of their party, but it's their voters who have put it in this position.  RNC leadership might rail against Trump, but they need to raise the character of their voters.  These voters were created by the same media that Republicans have used to vilify Democrats.  And ironically, some of that media has come apart with the ignominious departure of Roger Ailes.<br/><br/>Donald Trump, as he rants conspiracies in Green Bay, is only an outward symptom of a much deeper disease within the Republican Party.  Right now, no one has a cure.",
