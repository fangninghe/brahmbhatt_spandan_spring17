I \"met\" him first here in the states through Modern Love and immediately began a glorious feast backwards through his catalog. He was my comfort through adolescence, and beyond, and did give rise to this enormous feeling of adventure, excitement, the largeness of the world, and the possibility within it. You said it best: he made me feel alive, and not alone in my alienation. All through his music, the lyrics, the variety. I was never ever bored. I could never choose one song or even one album, perhaps, but for the helluvit I'll mention Five Years, Soul Love to Moonage Daydream as a long loved trilogy that I must have listened to hundreds of times. RIP. I am glad that so many appreciate the only idol I ever had.",

An unfortunate truth that we all bear together. This fact also makes it imperative that any thought of first use capability can have no place in military planning. Perhaps in some distant future, a united world will exist in a state of total freedom. The dream of total disarmament may then finally be obtainable. Until that time, we live in a world where technologies that used to take a city of engineers to master can now be developed within the quiet corner of an office park.",

His \"Davy Crockett\" weighed 50 pounds!  There were once nuclear artillery shells too.  But that was then, in the Cold War.<br/><br/>As McPhee reported, Taylor saw the big picture and realized that nuclear proliferation could not be enforced by secrecy, since any competent nuclear physics graduate student, with financial backing, could build a primitive \"gun-type\" weapon (the Hiroshima bomb).  By controlling access to special nuclear materials, many countries (and a number of other groups) could be prevented from building devices that, although likely to fizzle, would cause radioactive damage and mass hysteria.  He was able to convince the US government of this, and the US carried the ball further into international agreements.<br/><br/>This book is not for the technological elite, although the reader will learn what the title means, a thing to know.  It's more about people and processes at the time that McPhee wrote the book in 1974.  It is an excellent but sobering read.",

As it is people are still not willing to pay because they have no skin in the game. We cannot repossess the knowledge they gained through those loans.
