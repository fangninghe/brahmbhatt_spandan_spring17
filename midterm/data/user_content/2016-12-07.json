I travel throughout the world and have been many times to Europe, it is much changed since my last visit there, although I'm sure you wouldn't notice it from your safe perch in a nice hotel, just as those who favor unfettered immigration have nothing to fear from their safe perch in Manhattan or Lincoln Park. Sorry pal, it's a mess.  And really, pulling out the NPR screed of the day on \"fake news\", it's not fake, there is a problem, read the rest of the posts here.  You want to know why Donald Trump is your president, because everyone else is a deplorable, if they don't go along with every little thing you say. I don't consider myself xenophobic or racist and well, I do read, I do travel and I do consider the comments of people like you. I consider them just another lecture from people who don't have to live in my part of town and didn't lose their factory job to an illegal immigrant.  Perhaps you should have listened instead of lecturing.  Sincerely, ignorant white person (legal immigrant) who voted for Hillary and is trying to understand the reason she lost.",

				"commentBody": "Some of the comments here dont grasp the sublties of the situation in Saudi Arabia. Since 1979 following the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca there has been a split in the \"wahabbi\" school of islam. On one side of that is the group that says that the law comes from god and earthly leaders do not have ultimate right. On the other side of that split is the group that says earthly leaders are to be respected. This came about because when the Ickwhan invaded the Grand Mosque in 1979 the clerical leaders of saudi arabia had to grant the Saudi king permission to attack the mosque - which they did. And by doing so effectively tied themselves to the Saud family. The supporters of the Mahdi and the Ickhwhan who attacked the mosque never forgave those clerics or the Saud family. Osama Bin Laden was one of those supporters.<br/><br/>So Saudi Arabia has the \"official\" establishment wahabbi clerics and also the non-official wahabbi's. This mirrors the english civil war problem and the  \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's\".<br/><br/>the Sauds sit on a razors edge between provoking a religious uprising and advancing and progressing their country in a civilised manner.<br/><br/>The article does not make clear that it is the \"nonoffical\" wahabbi's  of Saudi Arabia who support the taliban and ISIS. That leads people to mistakenly think the Sauds should be abandoned. But that would be a serious error and hand Saudi Arabia to the very bad and backwards Wahabbis. ",
