				"commentBody": "With all due respect to Ms. (Madam) Albright's luminous and obviously fulfilling previous career as former US diplomat,  but speaking as a middle aged woman myself  I think it would be fair to ask, woman to woman,  why on earth did it take four very long days for her to issue this late Friday evening mea culpa??    <br/><br/>This is exactly the kind of whitewashing double standard behavior I see far too often from people of my own gender who somehow think they can out do the men with their narcissistic level of shaming and humiliating and truly makes me want to run very fast and very far from the 'feminist' crowd.   Dear Lord.  If conducting oneself in public in the manner that both Albright and her favorite politician Hillary Clinton have shown lately,  I'm grateful that my grandmother taught me years ago to listen only to myself.  Good grief. ",

If that's all you have to say, I feel shame for you,much the way I feel shame for those who do &amp; watch these called 'reality tv' housewives shows. I get that it's 'entertainment', just like WWF, but seriously,  sometimes I wonder if young people growing up on that can tell there's a difference. The ignorance featured for comedic entertainment on late night talk shows is alarming. Go back and reread the letter. In  Madeline Albright's time things didn't go viral the way they do now. Can't we have some compassion to recognize that something  that was meant to wake women up and help each other was said mistakenly not giving full thought to the context and these viral times?  The war on women is only going to continue if we become timekeepers of minutia like hair, clothes, calves, and apologies.  Under fascism the trains run on time.  And yet today some people nowadays are idolized for never apologizing. Your lionizing a former Secretary of State for her delay in apologizing in an Op Ed piece is pathetic .",

How many of us have ever gotten appalled stares from strangers when we reprimanded one of our children in public? Fortunately, most of our slip-ups aren't recorded on the web for the world to see and aren't really an indication of our relationship with our children.<br/><br/>This teacher doesn't hate children; teaching is unbelievably difficult and there's no reason to stay in the profession if you don't believe in the urgency of what you are doing. She's obviously hell-bent on helping her students to achieve their absolute best and believes that she is doing the right thing.

				"commentBody": "This culture of learning is unfortunately not unique and the reason two enthusiastic, ambitious friends also departed from separate schools (in two different states) in a different charter school network (the referenced \"Got to Go\" article describes this school's similar hands clasped, no-movement-or-else-punishment mentality). They were so passionate, not to mention incredibly capable, and teachers' short duration of time in the network before resigning does not discredit their reasons for doing so, contrary to Ms. Powell's statement. Quite the opposite - it is extremely telling and discouraging that our youngest teachers are becoming disillusioned and leaving so quickly from positions in a profession that so terribly needs them. The conditions under which the children must learn are troubling and merit a reexamination all to their own. <br/><br/>But I am also concerned with Ms. Moskowitz's self-righteous self-defense and inability to listen and learn from critiques - she is certainly no model for the students in her schools who are belittled to change their behavior, and 3 to 5 hours a week on-site are insufficient for claiming to provide exhaustive answers anyway. Ms. Moskowitz must learn to swallow her pride and finally begin to respond to criticism with recognition, humility, and maybe even change.",

However, a school that advertises itself as an advocate for every student's success should help every student succeed. A stern teacher can be effective for everybody, but a teacher who shames academically weaker students for making mistakes is only effective for the academically stronger students. <br/><br/>It is not up to the parents to determine what is best for their children when schools pretend to help every student, but actually only help the students who need the least help.",

				"commentBody": "Is everyone kidding me? This teacher is in absolute full control of her words, her demeanor, her  approach, and her intended outcome. She is smart, thoughtful, and is using a particular approach to educating her students. I, for one, disagree with it, but I see that it is studied and carefully planned. The student who was berated was not alarmed or surprised, and knew EXACTLY where to go and why. The other students were also fully cognizant of the level of fear they were intended to feel and why. How on earth could this be called a \"momentary lapse\" when the teacher articulates her \"deep disappointment\" with such complete control. We can choose controlling, patriarchal, nearly violent and abusive methods to teach our students, which are common in some other large, rival countries, or we can choose otherwise. The difference is whether we are trying to educate students to live in a future despotic regime, or in what we used to think of as a democracy. And if you think I'm joking about \"abusive,\" what on earth kind of person thinks that using language like that with sensitive children could possibly be appropriate or lead to the development of the kinds of people we hope will live in our society in the future?

As someone who is often in the assistant type role I can only imagine that the relationship between the teacher and assistant teacher has become poisonous. For kids to succeed the adults need to be in-sync and that clearly isn't the case. Furthermore, while I've said things I wish I could take back, the scholar made an academic mistake while still maintaining high behavioral expectations. She could have easily redirected with, \"what did you show me at your desk?\" For Teach Like A Champion readers its, Assume the Best and Manage your Affect.

I hesitate to call for subtlety when the discussion surrounding charter schools is so rarely subtle, but the article and many of the comments make an assumption about the context that seems incorrect. <br/><br/>If this is a response to misbehavior, this video is a fairly extreme example of what it looks like when a student gets under a teacher's skin. Ms. Dial's behavior is unsavory but familiar to any teacher who has had a difficult relationship with a student. It is unfortunate that the Times felt the need to shame this teacher in the service of making its larger point about Success Academy. ",
