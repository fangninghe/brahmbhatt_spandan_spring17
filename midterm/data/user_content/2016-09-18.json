				"commentBody": "Trump was more than just an unconstrained plurality. AS the field narrowed down, he remained dominant. He was rebellion against all of them, starting with more-of-the-same Bush, but finally every one of them. That is why those trying to sound like moderate sensible Republicans like Kasich got nowhere against him.<br/><br/>Senator Sanders was also a rebellion. It was more sane than Trump, but it was rebellion all the same. It was defeated by status quo.<br/><br/>Bush might have done the same as Hillary, except that he was so very bad as a candidate that even a $100 million head start and all possible insider support could not save him. <br/><br/>Hillary was more effective among Democrats than was Bush among Republicans. However, by putting down the rebellion among Democrats, she gave the rebellion side to Republicans. That is how Trump gets away with all he does, that is his cover.",

				"commentBody": "I learned long after I left the university that the differences between different schools was not reflected in ratings, or even in college guides. I also learned that different schools will suit different students. One may very well need a college education to even begin to choose the proper college.<br/><br/>I also learned that some students will learn, no matter what they do, and that some will not learn, no matter what they do. The school makes only a little difference for either of those groups, although more for the former. The difference matters most for the majority in the middle, so more effort should be spent on those students. But it is very difficult to match the student to the college.<br/><br/>There are other things that I have learned about colleges, like you may not learn what you learned in college until many years afterwards, that what you get from a class may not be what the class is about, and that the path you choose may not be the path you are ultimately led to.<br/><br/>If all this seems confusing, I will end with one experience I had. The best discussion about how to choose a college came when I took my niece to discuss how she should choose with a professor I know. I would recommend that any college-bound student try to do that.",

				"commentBody": "My mother and I took the hour-ish train ride from Rome to Spoleto, rented a car and spent a week exploring this beautiful area in fall 2013. Our home base was the organic stone farm agriturismo Localita al Piano, whose American-Italian owners grow heritage fruits, make goats milk cheese, and lead forest foraging walks. We made day trips to Norcia - quiet and small, with memorable wild boar's heads - the source of the famous salumi - decorating storefronts; to beautiful, historic Assisi, brimming with excitement as it prepared to host the new Pope, who had chosen their namesake saint's name as his own; to tiny Spello, another quintessential hilltop village like so many in the valley; and many trips into Spoleto, a large hilltop city, home of the famous music festival and to Roman ruins, gorgeous vistas, the rebuilt acquaduct, the duomo ... a living town, not glamorous, a little worn down, but wearing every one of its hundreds of years of history one on top of the other. And, unlike Rome and Florence at that time of year (September), none of these places were remotely overwhelmed with tourists, though Assisi is certainly more tourist destination than *normal* town.",

				"commentBody": "As a professor, I am always amazed how much influence is wielded among public college administrators by the rankings of this magazine. Most academics don't read it and writing for it would do nothing for your academic reputation and promotion, but I have heard presidents demand that 'their' college should have an improvement in the rankings as a top goal for the year. What a sad case of the tail wagging the dog.<br/><br/>After a long academic career involving a small Christian college, a large state university, an elite liberal arts college, two Ivies, the City University of New York, and universities in Europe, I have found that the good students are equally good wherever you go. It is fair to say that elite institutions generally have a higher proportion of good students than less elite ones. What is more important is the self-assuredness of elite institutions whose faculty feel much freer to do what they consider to work well, while administrators at the lesser institutions don't want to give their faculty that freedom.",

				"commentBody": "As a long time Penn State alumnus I feel compelled to support this principled student who clearly is the adult in the room. Much of the vitriol from some PSU alumni and others reflects the raging hyper-partisanship we see in so many aspects of our society. It doesn't matter if children were raped on Paterno's watch in his facilities by his right-hand man, the tribe must be defended and football (the game, of which I enjoy) must continue at all costs. The consequences of this mindset is plain to see for anyone who is willing to look. I hope we come to our senses soon.",

				"commentBody": "If I remember correctly, the raison d'etre of a university is to teach students, to provide them with the skills to reach out and become the future. Until then, the risk in life is entirely theirs, and, in this world, there's an awful lot of risk. Alumni, living in the past, don't share that risk and are more secure in their present. You're job is to support your university to foster current students and the next generation of leaders, not mindless robots to rah-rah-rah at the next game of gladiator. If you demand of students unflinching mindless obedience to superiors and an institution, then perhaps you should have gone to joined the military.

What one develops in college are<br/>1) intellectual interest<br/>2) good study habits<br/>3) good habits of reasoning and argumentation<br/><br/>These are almost impossible to acquire in a vacuum. Furthermore, they can't be instilled by a teacher. One must participate in a culture of learning. This requires a focused, intelligent community. <br/><br/>What distinguishes schools like Swarthmore and Penn and wesleyan for schools like UMBC is that at the former about 90% of the students are highly intelligent and focused and at the latter only about 12% are that way. Those 12% maybe be just as smart as the students at the more elite schools, but they are far fewer in number, which makes an intellectual community an impossibility. Certainly schools like UMBC will have a bunch of motivated students who can basically do it all on their own. Kids like that can go anywhere. Schools like Cornell and Tufts and Haverford and Brown and great for very intelligent kids who are not fully committed to education. By being around other highly intelligent kids, those kids become more interested in intellectual development.  ",

As for attacking Bernie, he was legitimately critical of a number of Bernie's policy claims.

They also pervert the decision making process in universities, I work at a large public university and our president and provost have become obsessed with the rankings and are making a number of decisions whose goal is solely to increase the US News Ranking. These decisions are at odds with what is best for our current students and for the long term health of the university. It reminds me of CEOs  who do what ever is necessary to drive up stock prices, even when those decisions are not in the long term best interest of the company and its employees.<br/>Rankings do not reflect the experiences of students and the quality of education. Most of the highly ranked universities do not value undergraduate education and teaching, yet parents wrongly assume that the rankings reflect the quality of education their children will receive.<br/>Parents do deserve information about educational quality. BUT the current ranking system does not provide that and worse it has greatly perverted how universities are run.",

Interestingly, I have independently discovered roughly the same solution, only I use regular earbuds and just put one of them in the right ear, as I am mostly a side sleeper. If I wake up, I turn over and reverse the earbuds. Instead of audio books, I listen to BBC Podcasts (BBC.co.uk/podcasts). They have tons of them in many categories. I listen mostly to science and documentary ones, but there are many others in the arts, sports, business, and more. They are free (and free of commercial content), professionally presented by talented and informed people, and the accents seem to help as well (oddly enough). The only drawback is that I go to sleep within 15 minutes (the normal fall asleep time!), so have to do each podcast (30 to 60 min) two or three times to hear the whole thing. <br/><br/>I write to them once a year or so to thank the British people for paying their license fees and helping me not only to sleep, but to learn so much about the world and it\u2019s people.<br/><br/>I will try Mr Ackerman\u2019s podcast out of curiosity and add it to the mix.
