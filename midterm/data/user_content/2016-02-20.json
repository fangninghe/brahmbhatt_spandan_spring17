My already low level of respect for anything named Apple or i-anything due to it's horrendous history of tax loophole advantaging to the tune of 65 billion/year is nearing rock bottom.    Sneering at our justice system this way just further exacerbates more 'line in the sand' business behavior from others.  As if we need to further elevate the marketers of the world.    ",

				"commentBody": "@Richard: Okay; so I guess you're not one of those conservatives who've been indicting this President over these past eight years for his NOT having acted in a bipartisan manner.  I stand corrected and assume you'll be in the Democrats' corner during the next Republican administration when President George Bush V accuses the opposition of not accepting his outstretched hand to put through an agenda calling for (still) more tax cuts for the affluent and (still) more benefit reductions for what remains of the middle class.  For the record, I agree that Mr. Obama should look for a moderate SCOTUS nominee (albeit one who vows to safeguard Roe v Wade as the law of the land- which would in and of itself disqualify him/her in the eyes of every Republican senator who doesn't hail from Maine).  On the other hand, I'm grateful that some friends of mine who've been afflicted with cancer and couldn't previously afford decent medical coverage have been able to take advantage of the ACA despite the sentiments of so many misguided conservatives.  The program is flawed, but it's honorable AS WELL AS legitimate and an obvious improvement over the big fat zero that the Republicans had offered.  And, please recall, Medicare wasn't all too popular when that program was originally implemented. Thank heavens that LBJ didn't heed the legion of naysayers who were denouncing that example of socialized medical care! ",

By 2020, we get rid of the miserable Bush years in the record, and the ten-year moving average would move back up almost to the 2% mark.<br/><br/>This makes the Friedman forecast an implausible joke of a forecast. He used economic multipliers that apply at relatively low growth rates and with slack labor demand, to a full employment scenario extended over a 10-year period. By 2016 year end, we will add another three million private sector jobs, and get within several million jobs of the all-time high employment level we hit at the end of the Clinton era.<br/><br/>Thats when Friedman's forecast period kicks in, and from this almost full employment scenario his forecast adds  +35 million jobs over ten years, compared to 9 million the CBO used to match working age population growth +  immigration. The other +26 million workers must come from the current population, even with accelerating retirements and more people in school. Friedman (and Sanders) are wrong with this unrealistic and unbelievable forecast of record high LFPR by 2026.We only get this LFPR if we use forced labor camps for elderly people. <br/><br/>The GDP growth estimates are worse... as we add marginal employees, Friedman forecasts a big acceleration in productivity growth. Bottom line, Krugman et.al. are correct, and Friedman/Sanders forecasts are off. The Rs will have an easy time ripping Sanders apart.",

They hunker down and elect the RIGHT people who can work with an opposition to move us forward.<br/><br/>Lucky we have so many young Democrats who react to Bernie in the same way, despite his immediate status of lame duck were he to be elected: he has about as much chance of getting anything through Congress as I have of turning this into a conservative forum. But, then, Bernie the Scold won\u2019t be nominated, while Trump the carny barker may be both nominated AND elected.<br/><br/>You really want to torpedo Trump? Stop emphasizing his absurd retractions of even more absurd statements: keep pointing to his hair and asking whether we REALLY want a president named \u201cDonald\u201d.

				"commentBody": "This was a very interesting challenge to look at lying and the scenarios where it is acceptable or even required. The two that I struggle with being acceptable are 1 and 9. In both of these, it is lying out of convenience more than necessity really, and honesty should be preferred when there are alternatives. <br/><br/>In 1, I could honestly tell my wife that I will not tell her where we are going but she will enjoy it. If she persists, I have to honestly divert it. Avoiding having to deal with that engaement is where the lying comes in.<br/><br/>Nine was very similar in nature to me as 1. I could honestly tell the salesperson how much I was willing to pay. While the salesperson tried to edge that up, I would have to hold firm, no matter how minimal the increases seemed. To avoid that struggle, I lie to meet my original goal in an easier manner.<br/><br/>David Nyberg's defense of applied lying would support the Kennedy example in 6 as well as scenarios 2, 3, and 4. Nyberg views deception as an \"essential component of our ability to organize and shape the world, to resolve problems of coordination among individuals who differ, to cope with uncertainty and pain, to be civil and to achieve privacy as needed, to survive as a species, and to flourish as persons\" (qtd. in Johannesen et al, 2008).<br/><br/>Johannesen, R.

Claiming that they have to re-write entire OS or create a new OS is farfetched notion.<br/>Funny Apple wants to make money in this country and yet shares no moral responsibility to help protect the very country where they live and prosper.

I gather there is relatively little dispute about this?<br/><br/>The argument about longer-term consequences is subtle, and I have heard no discussion about that at all.  The question is whether whatever the government taking the increased taxes uses the money to do is more productive (as an investment) than the wealthy would have been if they'd not had it taxed away from them.<br/><br/>Looking at what the wealthy have accomplished with the Bush tax cuts, I'd say the argument is on the socialist side.",

In order for that to happen people must have money to buy whatever it is he produces. The problem is that people just do not. Wages have stagnated at best and too many are not working for various reasons.<br/><br/>That is why the money that rich people have IS either sitting idle in a bank vault somewhere or, more likely and even worse, being invested in financial speculation which does not help the economy and actually poses risks.<br/><br/>And Stephen please tell me where does money come from anyway?",

				"commentBody": "I have seen many game the Veterans preferance system and repeatedly go back to the VA for increases in their preferance. I was a GS-15 hiring manager  and the schemes I saw by vets would make you want to puke. I am sure that as more and more of the jobs that were traditionally set aside in government for Veterans returning to the workplace have been contracted out. Especially since George W. Bush 8 year payback to campaign contributors. Obama has been about hiring Black females ( many unqualified and angry the EEO director of my former agency strangled a Black male EEO investigator.<br/><br/>While I know several highly qualified black professionals they are the most outraged as to what has occurred during the Obama administration and who has been promoted. <br/><br/>Any federal jobs that formerly had Veterans preference requirements ( that basically excluded everyone else, Custodial, landscaping, food service, hospital orderly, facility maintenance workers, basically all of the WG series,  should be required when contracted out that the contractor require the same Vet preferance. <br/><br/>It used to be that there were enough blue collar jobs that even with a less than honorable or general discharge that you could still get selected for a positon. When I found out that any of the supervisors below me ever selected someone with a DD-214 that had less than honorable let alone a General dIscharge I questioned their judgement in hiring. In fact, we stopped letting them select certificates anymore. ",

				"commentBody": "I did not know that the number of vets from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan put out with less than honorable discharges was as high as it is.  I don''t think anyone could believe that this many men volunteered for these two wars were cowards and that is essentially what a less than honorable discharge it.  We hear the horror stories of the My Lais and Abughrabs but when it's about the horrors of what the grunts faced, we have been content to sweep it under the<br/> rug.<br/>I fully support Congressman Coffman's effort and hope those reading this story will contact their members of Congress to support this effort.<br/><br/>We as a nation did promise to take care of those who stepped forward and even though I like Bernie Sanders and President Obama opposed the war in Iraq, I fully support the promise to take care of those wounded.
