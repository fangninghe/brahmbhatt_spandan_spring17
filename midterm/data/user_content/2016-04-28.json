I think he should turn down the crusade just a notch and talk about other pressing issues- everyone now knows he's firmly (and loudly) on the side of the underprivileged, and wants the over-privileged to pay a fairer share. I\u2019d like to get a better idea how he\u2019d handle some of the other issues, such as terrorism, keeping a handle on nuclear proliferation, and global warming. He has shown himself to be very hard worker and a pragmatic guy who really thinks things through, and I\u2019d like to hear what he\u2019s thought about regarding these other issues. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s what other older people are waiting to hear, as well.",

				"commentBody": "Far less outrageous than the idiot on his phone who plows into another car and kills 5 people.  <br/><br/>Smartphones are just portable computers.  When you use a phone and the internet what level of privacy do you have, expect, or need?  These devices are have now been distributed to everybody.  People are addicted to them and can't put them down.  The car manufacturers supply features that encourage their use while driving.  The automobile has simply become a moving living room and people truly forget that not only are they going 60, 70, and 8o mph, but that they have to actually watch where they are going, too.  The roads have become a house of horrors and the possible invasion of the privacy I may have over my phone contacts and usage is the last thing I am worried about.  I am far more concerned with my car being invaded by another vehicle.  ",
