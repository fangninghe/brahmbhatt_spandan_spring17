This article assumes that the US \"node\" has some extraordinary power vis-a-vis all the other national nodes on Earth.<br/><br/>The reality is that supra-node physical trade, and free-flowing finance among 100+ country nodes is now the dominant force of a unified global economy, and the national nodes have relatively little influence.<br/><br/>The Chinese stock markets are flipping around, but China still has the largest single physical production engine on Earth, and it has more than 150,000,000 expat citizens who either control or influence more than 50% of the physical commodities on Earth - and can ship them anywhere on short notice.<br/><br/>India has the largest and most diverse commercial democracy on Earth and can use barter, not government controlled currency to absorb economic shocks.<br/><br/>7 billion mobile phones, with 90% per capital penetration in the poorest regions of Earth, transmit more than $400 billion of \"remittances\" among guest workers of the world.<br/><br/>The \"Tinkertoy\" economic models of the 20th Century are now as obsolete as the land line telephone.<br/><br/>And traditional economists are been left behind by waves of human connectivity.",

It will smooth out as the Chinese Financial people are doing the right thing to stabilize it sanely and pragmatically.

				"commentBody": "Stock market trading halt again is a small indicator of a larger problem. Fear, greed, inflated prices, corrupt system, political manipulations and social mobility issues are all factors contributing to stock market collapse and economic disasters. Fed reserve is printing more money than it should have since 1930's. Chinese are following the same Market Economy Principals, the traders not the political junta, to make more money in the shortest possible time. <br/><br/>Chinese people's ambitions are more real and challenged by population pressure, history, competition, greed and social mobility. Fear has no limit, greed has no end, regulations and their implementation at global level may determine different results in events of crashes. Ripple effects would reduce people's savings in US to nothing, a painful reality, unfolding gradually. Lawmakers in USA have to work on Campaign funding rules to minimize lobbyists influence in engineering disastrous decisions, policies and their outcome. Or the supreme court can take affirmative action in curtailing political corruption to make lawmakers accountable for not acting in the best interest of their people and country. <br/><br/>Chinese corruption, greed and power struggle in society would manifest in stick market debacles and send more shock waves to US and rest of the world. To minimize the effects, US have to put its house in order, the   Congress and Senate should legislate what's needed, not what a few interest groups want.   ",

At the end of your posting, you raise the question about whether or not the Wall Street Gang is doing it's job, paying attention.  I think that unfortunately, they are doing their job, which entails most of all making huge sums of money for their rich and elite clients. In the process they make obscene amounts of money for themselves. They don't care about the small fry kind of people such as yourself and my mother, who lives a lot on the investments she and my dad made to live on in their retirement (golden years). My dad died from cancer in June 2014, and I worry about my mom and her supporting herself at 85 yrs of age. This of course is of no concern for the greedy, money grubbiing, bottom feeders that make up this self centered financial world nowadays. I long for the time when a man's word was the most important thing, his passport in life.",

Now, the bubble suppose to continue to grow from employed people pumping money into it. The problem is with wage stagnation and low paying jobs people unable to pump more money for the bubble to grow. Banks are back to their old habits.The Chinese has manufacturing bubble. They kept manufacturing goods thinking there is an ever ending export market. Having realized that is a mirage, they are trying to develop domestic market. The problem is they kept wages artificially low, so people don't have money, which is complicating the development of domestic market. The bottom line is that U.S lost the middle class while China never had it. ",
