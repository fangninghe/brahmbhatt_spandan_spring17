				"commentBody": "It is certainly good that some of the Carrier jobs are staying in the US. But con man Donnie's Carrier deal was a failure compared to what he promised.  Throughout the campaign, Trump promised to save all of the Carrier jobs by making clear that he would tax the heck out of the sale of Carrier's products in the US if they moved production overseas.  Instead, Trump gave Carrier all kinds of tax giveaways and subsidies (and who knows what else) to a company that is moving 1,300 jobs to Mexico. And he's provided a roadmap for every other large corporation in the US to use their workers as pawns in an effort to extort the US for subsidies, tax giveaways, and other legislative favors. That's hardly the type of strong leadership that Trump pretend during the campaign that he would provide. <br/><br/>In 2009, faced with the possible collapse of the auto industry, President Obama took action and provided government loans (which were paid back) combined with restructuring plans, and thereby saved the US auto industry. Such action saved 1.5 million jobs in the US.  In order to catch up to President Obama's record, con man Trump would just have to carry out a Carrier-style deal every week for the next 36 years. He could speed it up a little by producing Trump-branded merchandise in the US, rather than Vietnam and Mexico, and by using US steel in his buildings. But Trump has never cared about American workers, so he certainly won't do that.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive</a>",

It didn't augur well for  Italy  and it won't for the United States. Globalization and free trade require businesses, large and small, to make smart economic decisions, not clumsy, token political ones.<br/><br/>Politically, government pressure on business is  at odds with traditional conservative values of limited government, individualism, and free markets. How Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders will react will be interesting to observe. Will it be an invasion of the body  snatchers?",

As for your specific points:<br/><br/>First, the state of Indiana saved these jobs. Trump showed up to take credit.<br/><br/>Two, Trump didn't use taxpayer money. Pence used Indiana tax breaks, effectively raising taxes on everyone else in the state.<br/><br/>Three, the taxpayer money Obama used in the GM bailout was paid back with interest by GM. It also saved a million-plus jobs across the Rust Belt in the depths of the worst recession since the Depression, when losses of that magnitude would have been catastrophic.<br/><br/>Four, the loss of manufacturing jobs is now mostly due to technology. The best way to cope is not by demonizing offshoring, but rather with initiatives like the manufacturing innovation institutes described at manufacturing.gov. And with education and retraining and a subsidized transition period for affected workers, as Carrier was going to provide. Anything else is just playing for time.",

But it is evil to incentivize a firm employing working class folks making $30-50 thousand/year in Indiana. They obviously have not learned anything from this election. It is exactly this hypocrisy from the Democratic Party and mainstream media that led to Trumps victory and this behavior will only continue to weaken the Democratic Party going forward.",
