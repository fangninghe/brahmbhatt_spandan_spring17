What we've lost, largely by amateurish decisions made by non-military leaders, have been lengthy occupations with nation-building as the goal, a mission our military doesn't understand and that our own nation stinks at.<br/><br/>We've grown wiser about our limitations. If Mattis and Trump keep our military focused on military and not global social objectives, they'll do us as proud as they always have.",

				"commentBody": "The most important space we have to worry about is the large quantity between the president-elect's ears.  He's appointing fundamentalists, zealots and science deniers to important positions, not to discover the truth, but merely to ensure that inconvenient scientific truths don't prevent businesses from belching billions of tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.<br/><br/>It's pointless to try to bring these people down to earth with rational discourse, evidence or scientific facts, because that's not what buoys them up.  More than forty percent of Americans think that the earth is no more than 10,000 years old.  That level of ignorance may explain how the president-elect got elected, but it also explains why it's so easy for ideologues in Congress to trivialize and demean scientific endeavors.<br/><br/>Besides, what does NASA know about anything?  It's just a bunch of eggheads wasting money on worldwide communication satellites, global positioning systems and predicting dangerous weather.  Who needs all that when you've got the Farmers' Almanac?<br/><br/>It's not much in the way of consolation, but given the political powder keg of religious wars, terror attacks, dismantling the social safety net and destroying affordable health care, we're likely to extinguish ourselves as species before the seas boil from runaway global warming.<br/><br/>But it is ironic that the president who promised to drain the swamp might just help to create one big enough to engulf the entire world.",

We run a large deficit and it is mainly with the PRC and has a negative impact on the Balance of Payments. It is due to policy choices. We run a 3 to 1 deficit against us in trade. We allow critical goods to be manufactured outside the US including important pharmaceuticals. It is time to reverse that process. It will be a painful transition but one well worth it. Along the way perhaps the US government will again take up the cause of the Tibetan people which seems to have been shuffled off.  Aside from which given our ongoing sale of complex arms to Taiwan the whole thing is basically bad theater. Taiwan is not going to be part of the PRC in any near or long term. ",

No, he did not make terrorism go away, and could not effectively extricate us from the morass in Iraq created by the Bush.

In this case you would be supporting that we base our policies on utter ignorance, which does not sound like a recipe for success.<br/><br/> Or (2) he was aware of our current foreign policy on the issue (held by the last six presidents, including Saint Ronald Reagan), and decided to undermine  the position of the current Department of State and a sitting president (yes, we elect our presidents for full four-year terms, not three and 10 months; Mr. Obama is still the POTUS), while he is still not the one in charge; which would probably fall under the Logan Act (1 Stat. 613, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 953).<br/><br/>And that's basically it, unless somebody else can add a third option here. A reckless ignoramus or a traitor. Your pick.",

Trump thinks he's a hot shot negotiator, a superstar businessman, a problem solver, a top-dog to whom people will listen, after all, he's a billionaire, TV personality and the President-elect of the United States of America. But what does the rest of the world think? More than half of his own country already thinks he's a conman, does the President of Taiwan or Pakistan really take him any more seriously? Or do they know that he has no foreign policy experience. Do they know that he's likely to take their flattering phone calls and in doing so make statements that will anger and create divisions with these countries adversaries? It's sad to see, but the world knows Donald Trump's flaws and they are already using them against him. ",
