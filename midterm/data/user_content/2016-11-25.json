This kind of supremacism is both unfounded and likely to end badly for the US, given its diversification and relative decline against multiple rising world powers. <br/><br/>Asia should be ruled by Asians. Its business conducted by Asians. The same goes for any other people in their regions of the world. This chauvinism is not only operationally correct, it is also morally just. It is America that has broken this basic respect for autonomy, usually in the name of democracy, liberalism, or something equally deplorable that they assume to be universal. <br/><br/>President Xi does not imply that all of Asia should be dominated by China, at most influenced by Chinese power and economics, the way it has been for millennia. It is United States that keeps military bases across the Asia-Pacific while accusing others of hegemony -- without any sense of hypocrisy, apparently.<br/><br/>If Mr. Trump is to be pragmatic, then he should seek to pivot away from Asia (and other places) in all ways except trade. In doing so, he will gain credibility in the eyes of the non-white, non-western world, in addition to dealing a mortal blow to the \"globalists\" he railed against throughout his campaign.",

				"commentBody": "'Putonghua, the now standard Mandarin, is an artificial dialect not actually spoken [by] the people.' No more artificial than standard Italian, based on Tuscan dialects spoken by the educated. As those familiar with Italy - like China, an ancient culture, with many local dialects, at times mutually unintelligible - will know, the standard national language, Italian, is the language one speaks with foreigners, i e, anyone who doesn't speak the local patois. The same thing is true of China. In both cases, the process of linguistic homogenisation has been hastened by universal primary education, radio, and more recently, television. Inevitable perhaps, but I must confess that hearing someone speaking genuine Romano, \u5317\u4eac\u571f\u8bdd, or, for that matter, v\u00e4sterbottniska here in Sweden, can bring tears of joy to my eyes....<br/><br/>Henri",

The dialect - with its own grammatical structures, phrases, and names that are not translatable to standard Mandarin - is sadly fading. The full scope of the dialect couldn't be demonstrated within the full scope of this short article, so sorry for any confusion.",

A big country like China with 56 ethnic groups is already tough enough to manage, why adds the local speaking tones to the already big problem?  I am sure every Chinese province has its own speaking tones.  Just image if US speaks 50 different tones (or pronunciation), one for each state, how could people communicate with each other?  Even without language barrier, California has succession petition after every election to be independent from US. Isn't that bad enough? Why tests China?",
