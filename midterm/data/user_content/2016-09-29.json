A gain, NOT A LOSS, of more than 50 Million jobs!  Now, it is well known that the jobs of today are very different than the jobs of the 1980s and those who did not bother to acquire the skills that the technology driven economy of today requires most likely can't get a job.  So Let's Make Them happy Again! by closing all universities and research centers and go crazy with coal mining!  That is how we will Make America Great Again!  Are we crazy?",

We're things really so bad that we needed to increase trade to this point?  Is 10% cheaper baby clothes and strawberries in winter worth the loss of millions of jobs and the destruction of our jobs in our manufacturing base.<br/><br/>Weren't we supposed to transition to a \"service economy\"? But those Walmart service jobs don't pay or offer the same economic purchasing power that a decent Union job at a mill or auto plant did. <br/><br/>It seems we have up a lot as a society for such free trade which in the end really only benefited corporations, those in their higher management, and this that trade or fund their shares. <br/><br/>Not to digress but even all the airline mergers haven't brought tickets down that much and they've made traveling to much of middle America a nightmare of plane connections. <br/><br/>Ross Perot was right about Nafta. And a lot of people warned of the impact of having China join the WTO, but both were good for corporations to get access to way cheaper labor.  Capital and goods are free to move around the globe now, but labor is prisoner to their boarders and communities. It's not a fair economic model.",

Voting for the \"lesser\" may get Hillary CLinton to win, but what is the USA going to truly get?<br/><br/>Up here in Canada it's business as usual as voters are \"getting the business\" from the Liberals who have been in power for one year. Some promises are not being met, and we, the voters threw out one demagogue for another. MInd you, Mr. Trudeau started out well, but there have been minor scandals here and as I mentioned, some promises have not been met. <br/><br/>We did have another party the last time that was the official opposition (New Democratic Party), but voters didn't like them either. So for now it's 3 more years of the Liberals.<br/><br/>Bottom line, one party may be blue and the other Red (like in the USA), but neither keeps their promises when elected, and there is no one else to vote for. <br/><br/>Voting for Mrs. CLinton is better than not voting or voting for a third party, but how much better will the Democrats actually be after having been in power for the last 8 years?",

What about people being lifted out of poverty by millions? China is portrayed by Trump supporters as some malevolent juggernaut snatching bread out of the mouths of American children. But China is composed of people just like you and me: mothers, fathers, families. Fifty years ago more than 40 million Chinese starved to death. Look me in the eye and tell me that I should care more for some American guy's declining standard of living than for a little girl's stripping bark off a tree because she has nothing else to fill her stomach. Global trade saves lives. Yes, blue-collar workers in the developed world are paying the price but it's nothing compared to the price others have paid for centuries. ",

It will cost the economy $1 Trillion dollars - that would be a lot of jobs for young people. The current estimate for a Trump budget sees a $5.3 trillion increase in national debt - medicare and other benefits the government now provides will be slashed, even though it is proportionally insignificant. Americans will most likely feel and be less safe and have fewer allies in the global community.<br/><br/>All it will cost Hillary is the presidency - she can go back to work for the Clinton foundation, and have an otherwise comfortable life. To put it bluntly, the rich, including most politicians will still do ok. The poor and the young not so much.<br/><br/>So if the point of the exercise is that the young will demonstrate how miserable they will be with President Trump and how much it will cost them, then I really don't get the logic of it.

As this article makes clear most of us are spectators (e.g. California will be for Clinton and Idaho will be for Trump) and only a few states decide the election.  The Electoral College may be very difficult to get rid of since smaller states (e.g. Idaho) get more power per person than large states (e.g. California) and they will fight hard to keep it.  If elections were based on congressional districts rather than national popular vote the political payoff for gerrymandered districts would be even higher than it is now.  Given the current state I would not favor that.  The only fair method is one person one vote and election on the basis of a national popular vote.  Regardless, it is clear that the worst system of all that I have seen proposed is the current system.",

They don't remember the country's fight to move left in the 1960s and its drift toward political indifference in the '70s. This indifference on the left led to Reagan being elected by a cohort of right-wing boomers and their parents who were still terrified of communism and hippies.<br/><br/>It was that election that brought us to where we are today. At the time my tiny generation of young people could see that Reagan spelled disaster for everything that the left held dear. We didn't have the numbers to outvote the boomers. We watched political progress be devoured by the corporate monsters that rule the world today. Our protests fell on deaf ears. Now the rest of the country is suffering from the consequences of an election young people were protesting 30 years ago!<br/><br/>The presidency has become the only thing stopping a gerrymandered House of Representatives from handing the country on a silver platter to the wealthy and the fundamentalist religions. The millenials gave me hope again, but they are falling into the trap of impatience. The ship of state is huge and doesn't turn quickly. We can elect HRC who will at least try to keep the right wing at bay while the rest of us get up off our butts and get a better organized left-wing political base that will really do something to turn the ship around. Real change requires long-term commitment.",
