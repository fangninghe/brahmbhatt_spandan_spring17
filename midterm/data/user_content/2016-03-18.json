				"commentBody": "In 2008, after Super Tuesday then, Hillary was around 100 delegates behind Obama. In 2016, Bernie was about 200 delegates behind.<br/><br/>Hillary maintained that 100 delegate gap through the entire primary and wound up 102 delegates behind Obama. Had some of her Super Delegates not switched sides, she would have won the nomination. But, the Supers saw that Obama was ahead in delegates and decided to go there, which was the correct decision and I say that as a Hillary supporter then and now.<br/><br/>Bernie is now over 300 delegates behind. If Hillary couldn't overcome a small 100 delegate deficit, how can Bernie over a 300 delegate deficit? How would need to win every single election going forward by 60-40 margins at least to secure the nomination.<br/><br/>That is not going to happen. The caucus states do not award that many delegates to begin with. And the primary elections he's won, outside of Vermont and New Hampshire, have been by rather small margins.<br/><br/>Bernie needed to win OH, IL and MO to remain viable and he lost all three, OH by a decent margin.<br/><br/>At this time last year, Hillary's campaign was in far better shape than Bernie is now. Remember, she won OH, CA, PA, NY, NJ and CT in the homestretch but it still wasn't enough.",

When people bring up to me all the criticisms about her in the news media, I remind them of the importance of weeding out fact from fiction. Regarding Obama's comments, I trust that he had good reasons to make them, although I'm not sure I entirely agree with them. I don't think he was trying to imply that she's his clone and will carry out his agenda. But she does support a lot of the work he's done (so do I!), so it makes sense for her to continue supporting that work.",

Trump says he's going to do a lot of things, too. There is no evidence that either has done anything effective except appear on tv and make noise.<br/><br/>Sanders has been in Congress for years. What change has he effected? Where has he been, besides appearing on Real Time? That's where he became a celebrity and mastered the sound bite. If Sanders had any kind of a record of action (besides making Bill Maher purr), I'd consider him a serious cabdidate. But he's no more than any other favorite guest on  talking head shows. <br/><br/>I'm not being rhetorical when I say I want to know why anyone thinks a man who has been quietly ineffectual in the house and senate for decades is suddenly going to roar to life as president and bring about societal change. How do you possibly see this happening? Especially explain how he can accomplish this in view of who writes legislation.",

Forget about the Iraq war, check his interview with Greenspan in 2003, way before the great recession.<br/>He has \"roared\" to life because some voters  are finally ready to hear him, but he has been alive in his beliefs and actions for a long time.<br/>He is not naive, and it is not about Bernie doing it alone. He believes and says aloud over and over that if (and when) people come out and vote (not just every 4 years), the politicians they elect will have to govern for their constituents and not just for special interest folks who pay for their campaign.  That is the \"social change\" (or revolution) he talks about. If people don't exercise their power by not voting, they will continue to be governed by the \"few\" and for the \"few\"<br/>How can he accomplish anything? For a starter he would continue to advocate for the things the public vote him for, he would  continue to engage with congress, senate and the populace, and  call out obstructionists . He would not be \"compromiser in chief\" when compromise is only in the interest of the \"few\".<br/>He would be the president of the people, for the people, and by the people.",

It took a long time for him to realize they never had any intention of working with him, nor would they, in any way, shape, or form. It was my worry about Ibama during the primaries in 2008--he was not understanding the prior 20 years' worth of GOP behavior, particularly obvious under Bill Clinton's presidency. Leaving aside the ridiculousness of that GOP position and the insidious bases behind it, I believe Obama was unable, due to the makeup of Congress &amp; the completely insane forces driving the decisions of the right  (now personified by Trump), to accomplish more than he has. His \"establishment-ness\" is nothing more than the end result of trying to legislate \"hope &amp; change\" with a crowd of unintelligent &amp; unempathetic legislators  who couldn't care less about the people they're meant to serve. The blame for not getting  the \"hope &amp; change\" we voted for--by a landslide in 2012--lies with Congress, not Obama. The same exact thing is going to happen to Sanders if elected (and Clinton too), unless a whole lot of people vote their congressional representatives out. But the track record for that is not good.",
