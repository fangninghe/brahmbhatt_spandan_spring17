				"commentBody": "The issue that I have with Clinton remains similar to 2008.  Iraq War vote and her doubling down on that decision undercut all of these claims about the value of her experience.  That was a major litmus test that she failed, and unlike John Kerry her tenure as Secretary of State doesn't do much to counter that perception.  <br/><br/>She has a great knowledge base, clearly, but what good is a great knowledge base if it isn't exercised with wisdom and responsibility?  <br/><br/>This has played out as well in other areas relating to the conduct of her campaign in 2008 and selecting a political campaign manager like Mark Penn who didn't even bother to learn apportionment rules.  It is playing out in 2016 with respect the installation of a former campaign chair at the DNC, who has grossly mismanaged the nomination process even before the first votes have been cast.  These are proxies for how she might actually manage a bureaucracy and the sense is that she may end up being loyal to a fault.<br/><br/>As a side note, I have been happy with Obama's tenure overall.  So the narrative about \"dashed expectations\" doesn't resonate for me.  One of the great things about Obama is that he and his wife weren't that far removed from the world that many of us live in, so even once he entered the bubble, he kept some connection to that old world.  The Clintons have been removed from that world for over 20 years.  I will support Clinton in the general.  However, I hope she will outperform my expectations, if elected.",

							"commentBody": "The claim about her being an \"evil, greedy manipulator without depth or redeeming qualities\" is attacking a strawman.  That's an easy argument.<br/><br/>The bigger issue, is that even with her experience, and her depth of knowledge -- something that is beyond reasonable dispute -- she still doesn't exhibit great judgment at times.  <br/><br/>I'm not really clear how Clinton's Iraq War vote speaks to \"human nature\", other than, perhaps, as an exhibit of a certain kind of weakness of character or judgment.  There are plenty of humans who said \"no\" to the Iraq War, even under a tremendous amount of political pressure.  Max Cleland lost his seat over his vote.  Others paid an even higher price.  Those who spoke out and voiced concerns that were vindicated should be recognized and celebrated for their judgment.  Those who failed to weigh the risks, also should be judged accordingly.<br/><br/>If Clinton had correctly diagnosed the risks, and weighed the balance appropriately, her stance would have been even more worthy of recognition than those who made the right judgment without the political pressure.  The fact is, she failed.  And she also failed to recognize the error for way too long.  <br/><br/>The kind of legacy that the Clintons want for themselves will matter a lot less to voters in 2016 than the kind of legacy that those voters want to leave for themselves and future generations.",

Didn't work out that way for her as hindsight, and facts, show that the war was a very bad idea.

				"commentBody": "Make no mistake about it, Israel has already abandoned the two-state solution.  The Likudniks won't acknowledge this publicly but every action they've taken since the first Intifada pretty much reveals that they have no intention of ever agreeing to the establishment of an independent Palestinian Arab state in Gaza and/or the West Bank.  They keep insisting on their right to expand old Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and to build new ones even while demanding that all acts of violence against Jewish citizens come to an end.   Even if the latter development were to actually come to fruition, Netanyahu and company would come up with some other equally unreasonable condition and continue to hold fast to the idea that \"facts on the ground\" must always be respected.  They're probably hoping that the U.N.'s member nations will ultimately come to the conclusion that Israeli arrogation of these \"disputed\" areas will be judged a fait accompli in much the same way as the Chinese occupation of Tibet has been treated over these past seven decades.  China, unfortunately, has the veto power of a permanent member of the Security Council.  In Israel's case, the U.S. has been doing the dirty work for it.  In this, his last year in office, perhaps Pres. Obama will finally give thought to dropping the U.S. veto against the establishment of a Palestinian state.  One can only hope.  ",

Acts of violence against Jewish or Palestinian citizens is unacceptable. Netanyahu and his political allies have done terrible harm to Israel. They sully it's name and honor. They have damaged it's security even though they think it's been strengthened. Their policies give strength and unintended support to terrorist organizations. They are busily turning the western world against them. A course change is needed. Perhaps what is going on in Israel reflects the ultimate end of the course the Republicans are calling for in the presidential race. Bar Muslims from the country, only let Christians in, close mosques, blame the other, take away the citizen rights of those who are not like the majority, the President needs to be Christian as should the nation, etc. It might be a good lesson to consider when listening to the Republicans rant.",

He was in office for more than 8 years.  <br/><br/>Obama's \"original sin\" was the too small stimulus in early 2009, which was bad politics and policy, however, I suspect when people look back that Obama will find greater vindication on several areas.<br/><br/>Our political system also isn't a one-man, term limited dictatorship.  Cooperation is absolutely key, and unless Sanders brings a bunch of clones alone with him to Congress in a massive landslide victory, and reconfigures the Courts, his commitments will be mostly limited to regulatory action.

I just don't like that you say you felt vindicated by the article. It's seems like your workout routine, at least for upper body strength, was not very efficient and that can be why your pull ups were agonizing. If that's what's stopping you, don't let it. It'll get easier once you find a routine that works for you.  Again though, if the strength part of fitness is not that big a deal for you,  then screw it.",

His characterization of some illegal immigrants as \"rapists\" is offensive and his ban on Muslims needlessly antagonizes the allies the US needs in the fight against ISIS.<br/><br/>Yet he speaks to the concerns of Americans forgotten by liberals, the American worker who plays by the rules, yet sees his economic position deteriorate as illegal immigrants destroy his community, overrun his schools and strain emergency rooms to the breaking point.<br/><br/>The US population increased by 36% during the period 1980-2010.  Unlike population growth in the past, the new population growth is encountering limits.  California for example is facing what is called a \"drought\" but is really too many people trying to live in a desert.  Unskilled and semiskilled laborers see wages decline as they compete with illegal immigrants.  LA is choking under a sea of smog.<br/><br/>It should be liberals who should be preserving the environment, encouraging smaller family size, helping the poor in Mexico improve Mexico, rather than immigrate to the US.  Instead they characterize any sensible discussion that resources are finite as \"racism.\"  Even Krugman sets up a new scapegoat, the \"white patriarchy.\"<br/><br/>Where should white males turn for addressing their grievances?<br/><br/>Trump at least starts to voice their concerns.

Decent manners aren't that hard to stick with, but it's part of the Trump crowd's attitude towards anyone who doesn't agree with them to show their toughness by getting ugly about everything right out of the starting gate.<br/><br/> We should all be working together to get rid of the plutocrats who have stolen most of our economy out from under us and are making plans to get the rest of it.  After we accomplish that, then we can get back to growling at each other past the partisan divide.<br/><br/>And it wouldn't hurt if we could inculcate a little \"political correctness\" back into the conversation.

				"commentBody": "@WZ:  I don't see how your calculations make sense.  I believe you left out some necessary information.  If US health care spending now is $8500p.c. and we shift $2000p.c. from military into health care, then the remaining health care expense is $6500p.c.  So?  All you've done is shift money around.  It says nothing about taxes, costs, etc.  You need to tell us how taxes would be affected.  At present, if I remember correctly, the U.S. government pays the lion's share of health care costs.  (Maybe that lion's share includes state government expenditures also.)  So, if $2000p.c. is added to the government funds available for health care, the government funds should be approximately equal to total present U.S. spending on health care.  In other words, your proposal (which I agree isn't politically possible) would enable the government(s) here to take over all health care without raising taxes.<br/><br/>That is the conclusion I get.  I don't see how you get any other conclusion.  Let's have some figures on actual governmental health care spending before drawing conclusions.",
