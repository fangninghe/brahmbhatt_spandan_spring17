It wasn't until word got out there was a politician who was pushing for free college education they even took and interest in Sanders, and then by attrition, they probably figured this guy would be getting all student loan debt forgiven.  And most of those that are threatening to cancel their subscription probably got their subscription for free anyway when a friend signed up and passed along the free subscriptions that came with the one they purchased.

The lack of coverage, and the skepticism of the media, has made it doubly difficult for him to introduce himself and his ideas to the general public.  I have long said that the more people see Bernie the more they like him, and the more they respect his main thesis.  He has done a great service this year, not only bums long Hillary a better candidate, but also by focusing on the core US problem of income/wealth/power inequality - something none of the other candidates don't talk about or even get.I hope that Bernie has shown that many Dems oppose the Clinton's desire to turn the Democrats into Republican-lite.  The younger voters \"get\" Bernie. They are the future. So is getting more info via social media.  Too bad traditional media closed their eyes to what is going on",

From the very beginning only two candidates tapped into that zeitgeist: Sanders on the left and Trump on right.<br/><br/>But selling papers and online advertising matter more to today\u2019s media than thoughtful discussions of thing like income equality. So the loud mouth bully has gotten the lion\u2019s share of the media attention and he\u2019s almost certainly going to be the GOP nominee.<br/><br/>I am a Sanders supporter who has been carefully and meticulously following and listening to the anger of the citizenry over the last eight or nine months. The discontent on both the right and left is unlike anything I have seen in the past 40 years. <br/><br/>I expect the overwhelming majority of the GOP leadership to cave and support Trump in the self serving hope that his victory will protect and even advance their own personal career and financial interests.<br/><br/>Clinton's base of support is, by contrast, exceedingly thin. Nor can it be overstressed that her most powerful message in November will be \u201cI am better than the alternative.\u201d If Clinton was once \"likable enough\", she isn't anymore. Indeed the level of vitriol felt against Clinton by those on the right and center (and with Sanders\u2019 presumed defeat some of the left as well) is beyond frightening.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I am anticipating a Trump victory in November.

							"commentBody": "The idea that anyone can predict Clinton's strength in November based upon her strength in the Democratic primaries (many of which were closed) strikes me as bizarre.<br/><br/>I have zero problem accepting that Clinton has sewn up the Demcratic nomination. Part of the reason for my post was to warn folks that I actually think she is very vulnerable IN NOVEMBER.<br/><br/>This has absolutely nothing to do with my favoring Sanders. It has everything to do with my not wanting to see Trump become president.<br/><br/>But rather than acknowledge that Secretary Clinton may have a tough road after the convention, the folks commenting here accuse me of being a Trump supporter.<br/><br/>THIS is exactly why Clinton is at risk of losing-- because you all think someone like me is the enemy for saying what ought to be a common sense concern. If you think the Sandernistas have been hard on Clinton, you are clearly completely clueless for what is coming after the conventions. Moreover, unlike Sanders, the GOP will have hundreds of millions in PAC money to spread their far more hateful messages.<br/><br/>As to NSH, taking Sanders out of the picture, of course HRC is the best candidate. But that doesn't mean her current campaign has her on a trajectory to win.<br/><br/>Finally, while I share FSMLives! presumed abhorrence with likability being a factor in choosing a president, it unfortunately influences a great many voters. (Remember the November election is not going to be determined by the folks who read the New York Times every day.)",

Because we deeply detest Hillary Clinton for abandoning the core values of the Democratic Party.

Perhaps voting for Donald Trump will force the DNC to play fair with Democratic candidates next time instead of letting Debbie Disaster run a black ops campaign. ",
