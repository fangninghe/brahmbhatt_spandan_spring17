It was not a small act: it was a violation.   It's tough if you're 18 to stand up to a presidential candidate.   Sharing it here, and speaking about it, taking it seriously, and teaching others not to accept this at ANY age, are a step to taking back our humanity and strength from those who try to take it from us.
