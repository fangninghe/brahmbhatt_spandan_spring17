If people were screaming  \"do something\" in response to the 9/11 attacks, which I assume you were referring to, Saddam Hussein had nothing, nothing to do with that attack on America. In fact, the 9/11 attacks were a distraction from a well-calculated plan by neocons and religious right leaders who had already set their sights on Iraq and impose western values to that entire region.  They first had to address those (Saudis) who perpetrated those attacks by invading Afghanistan and deliberately conflated the 9/11 attacks with the invasion they were planning all along for Iraq. George W. Bush's response in Iraq was not a 'knee jerk' response but a well planned invasion that had catastrophically disastrous  consequences.  It created the world we see today.",

Everyone in their right mind wants to prevent this. Obviously, the availability of assault weapons will tend to facilitate massacres by mad men. Obviously, there are other ways to commit heinous crimes that don't involve assault weapons. Obviously, the majority of Muslims abhor these atrocities. Obviously, it is no coincidence that these suicidal mad men tend to be Muslim. Something is wrong in those communities. Obviously, we need to condemn these murders and act swiftly and harshly to persecute anyone who abetted these murderers and knew about their  intentions without alerting the authorities. Obviously, Western nations need to come down harsher on the hateful imams sponsored by Saudi Arabia.

Where I live, that&#x27;s 198.5F.  Inevitably a post-soak simmer is required.  So I just keep it simple and simmer from the beginning.<br/><br/>Four pounds of chicken overwhelms the other other ingredients.  I added more of what I had to get something not too dry.<br/><br/>Finally, this recipe needs a lot of jazzing up to be interesting.",
