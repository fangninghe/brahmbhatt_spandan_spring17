				"commentBody": "I'm pretty sure both presidential candidates, and certainly the sitting president, have spoken freely and frequently about the need for America to step up it's propaganda campaign against ISIL particularly via the internet. I'm not sure what is wrong with \"counter programming\" to anti-American jihadist \"news\".  And, actually, calling the programming \"Voice of America\" is pretty above board.  As for it being in Somalia which I assume you are mentioning as though we are trampling on the Somalian government's rights to control what Somalians hear -- we do live in a global world and most people don't actually like the idea of a nation trying to control what it's citizens hear like China does.  So are the listeners in Somalia or are they citizens of the world and entitled to hear from the world at large?  As for Radio Free Europe I hate to break it to you but that is not news.  I don't know about this prohibition of distribution of government content to Americans, etc. but, guess what, everyone was in the military during the wars and mostly oversees and exposed to Radio Free Europe even if we weren't listening to it domestically.  It wasn't a secret.  Nor a secret that it was American/allied made news.  When countries could control the airwaves and only allowed state media Radio Free Europe was a very welcome and appreciated additional voice and resource and cherished by tens of millions around the world. You can find much worse governments than America, imperfect as it is.",

Most believed it is  probably out of duress and legally not binding.  Same with the chairperson of the Parliament who has much closer ties and history with Britain.  All Hong Kongers are victims.  But God gave man free will and made us in His image and likeness, that is our saving grace.

				"commentBody": "If PRC tried to stop booksellers from publishing books of political entertainment for the citizens of their own country by kidnapping them from HK, it is not stopping itself or its many fractions to buy up newspapers in HK and publish dailies of Cultural Revolution style reporting on political intrigues, innuendos and Marxist style purges and infighting in the CCP oligarchy for the entertainment of HK readers.  But they are seen as just that, entertainment, Soviet style.  Nobody in their right mind in HK or anywhere else, barred one, would think of kidnapping them.  HK is not China.  That is what it means.  If it were, HK people would be going around the world kidnapping the equivalents of the publishers of Vanity Fair, George magazine, National Enquirer, News of the World ... to achieve the Brave New World.  And that is only politically.  That is why the city of All Nations were on the street for 79 days 2 years ago and in the Parliament now.  If that voice is silenced,  it would be injustice.  The rest of the world would have to carry on their own and make the sacrifices these people make with their conscience.",

				"commentBody": "Hong Kong's autonomy has always been under threat.<br/><br/>As long as it makes economic sense for China to maintain HK as it is, they will do so. When China decides it no longer makes sense to maintain HK, they'll shut the place down just as quickly as an unlicensed noodle vendor.<br/><br/>Eventually they'll have the Spratly's built up to where they want it. Then they'll start to swing the gate shut. Probably around the same time they inform Taiwan their day is done.<br/><br/>I also suspect China thinks of the Spratly's as a futuristic Guangzhou for a Canton System. Control the trade from the south.<br/>Taiwan will gate the north.<br/><br/>Does anyone here really want to get into a shooting war with China?",

They cannot finish, they lack pace, and, most importantly, they lack heart.  A coach cannot fix these problems.

If a team lacks talent, a coach cannot overcome that complete lack of talent....oh wait, Swansea actually has one of the few coaches who could accomplish this seemingly impossible task.  If I recall correctly, the US topped the group ahead of England under Bradley in South Africa with a mediocre U.S. team (granted, that team had a level of heart a British team could only dream of).
