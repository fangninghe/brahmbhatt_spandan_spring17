				"commentBody": "It is astonishing that young college students enrolled full-time at elite colleges (a luxury that was unimaginable to previous generations) are convinced they are the most oppressed and victimized people in the country, even though the 35% of Americans who don't get to go to college are clearly the disadvantaged ones. You would never know it from the endless grievances, the victim Olympics, demands to be excused from class to attend protests, demands for trigger warnings, for grading leniency because world news is upsetting, the mandatory sorting and categorizing of everyone based on skin color, sexual orientation, religion, or ethnicity, as if their character and abilities and talent are meaningless unless we know their exact placement on the Pyramid of Oppression... all of this reflects poorly on college students of today.<br/>I respect for college activists who devote their efforts to improving the world, but that's not what this is. Do you think these students care at all about their peers who weren't fortunate enough to go to college, who are working low-wage jobs to support themselves and their families? Of course not! This is all about them and how cushy they can make their four years at college, how well they can train the cowering administrators to cave to their every whim.<br/>Colleges are allowing themselves to be governed by the demands of teenagers, and it\u2019s alarming. Providing an education in the classical liberal tradition is apparently not even an afterthought.  ",

While I agree that movements on campuses have always been \"wide-spread\" and \"confined to a minority of students\", the issues these students are passionate about extend beyond the campus. The resulting intense media coverage, including social medias, has caused administrators to make make changes in response to pressure more easily than in previous generations. Alumni are reacting to this by closing their wallets in some cases, and money talks. I'm assuming those mentioned in the article are white. Perhaps they feel that in trying to appease cultural demands, some of their culture, good or bad, is disappearing as a result. Ask any Trump supporter.",

				"commentBody": "Each generation needs a critique of society and its problems to use as a launching pad for their own take over of power and influence. First, gather in groups and come up with ideas. Spread those ideas and use them as a springboard. In this case, everyone who came before them is wrong and a society organized in any way against their interests, their comfort and their glorious future is not just wrong, but seen as evil. This is an obsessive, destructive and self defeating way of looking at the world. It reminds me nothing so much as the Red Brigades in China and the kind of ideas that led to Pol Pot's genocide in Cambodia. I don't mean it would necessarily lead to such drastic results, but it is dangerous nonetheless. Ideas bent in the wrong direction and pursued to conclusion can be enormously destructive. It is too bad that the people on the scene, professors and administrators, aren't pushing back hard.",

Vassar and its president have received a lot of good publicity for reaching out to more students from middle class and poor backgrounds.  In terms of admissions and financial aid, it's the upper middle class that doesn't find the welcome mat.  The sons and daughters of rich alums still get the royal treatment when it comes to admissions.  So do the kids who are first generation college students.  No wonder Vassar is in turmoil because of BDS. The campus is missing the kids that are the bridge between the rich, middle class and lower middle class. Quite frankly, it is the upper middle class that is squeezed out because the $70,000 price tag for tuition, room and board.",

I am not white or male but I am fed up with this touchy-feely sense of outrage at totally superficial issues or events. I read with laughter and incredulity,  recent opposition to serving Indian food at a campus cafeteria on grounds of 'cultural appropriation'. Give me a break. Who has time to sit in for this? We have reached heights of intolerance on both ends and are veering towards reverse racism. I can not stand obliterating older books buildings or art because times have changed. They all are testament to our history, our successes, failures and how far we have come. Build new things, create new art and bring forth new heroes for our time. Don't wrongly judge well meaning stalwart citizens who were products of their times (especially those who are no longer alive to clarify their true intentions or have a choice to act differently knowing what we know now).

Ironically this would hurt many of the students who are protesting for greater sensitivity, since many of these universities give full scholarships to those in need, which includes larger numbers of minority. That would be  a tragedy. I would hate to see free speech impeded ever. University is a great opportunity to experiment, to push the boundaries, to say whatever you think and deal with and learn from the response. I guess this is something for the kids to think about, but I also think the culture is changing and yes, some of the old white men might feel alienated. I guess then the universities need to hope their younger, hipper, more diverse graduates will earn enough to make up the difference.",

We live in the 21st century now-- a world \"plagued\" with socially-aware youth who have formed opinions different than those of their parents and grandparents by educating themselves on ever-present topics such as racism and sexism. While I personally disagree with some of the forms of protests from the current students and the reasons behind them, I also feel that generation gap between them and the alumni is the major source of misunderstanding. The youth now are trying to deal with issues the alumni's generations never solved, and thus the alumni will fire back in the best way they know how-- cut the funding. Unfortunately, the younger generation has the underhand when it comes to money, portraying us as reliant and needy when that is not at all what we want. We want to be independent and make our own way, solve our own problems and fix our parents mistakes. Economically and socially, Generation Y is about to take over the world.
