I imagine him whispering in Donald's ear:<br/>\"Donald you will never forgive yourself if you do not govern for all of the people and disavow racism once and for all\"<br/><br/>Smiling smugly and perched over his right shoulder is Andrew Carnegie tempting him: \"Trump. They're all out to get you. Stick it to 'em\"<br/><br/>Behind the president elect is none other than the halo of FDR talking directly to the American people (bypassing the MSM) during one of his weekly fireside tweets. Er... chats. ",

				"commentBody": "Hillary has been hounded an persecuted. Believe me. The judiciary would prosecute so if there were any case. This whole nothing burger served to cast aspersions on an honorable person who didn't really use email, but was running for office as a Democrat.  She preferred face-to-face communication and secure diplomatic pouches. Her email account was set up by State IT security experts who visited the basement where the computer was housed. She used her own domain, as she had as a senator. The email address was obviously not one from the State Department. Why did it take four years to notice if any damage could have been done? Classified information varies by government agency, and might be accidentally sent to unclassified servers. Information gets classified retroactively. One is innocent until proven guilty in our system.<br/>Wikipedia has more information as does Political Magazine whose author read the FBI reports. The State rulebook requires three printouts (and filing) of each email received. Rather absurd and dated. The computer system at State was out-dated and staff wasn't always able to print out emails. Secretary Clinton worked from pointed data. With adequate funding (tax money), State IT can be updated and technology from a decade ago used to ensure that emails are backed up incrementally on a nightly basis. No need to print and file each email, which I doubt anyone who needed to function had time to do. ",

So, the fact that Trump, after he spoke with General Mattis, sounded less excited about bringing back torture than he has in the past means very little, as Trump will almost certainly go back to his pro-torture views once he speaks with one of the many right wing crazies that he is filling his Administration with.<br/><br/>This editorial is certainly correct that it is \"alarming to confront how thinly thought through many of the president-elect's stances actually are.\" It would have been nice, however, if the New York Times and the rest of the media had spent time and resources during the campaign focusing on the fact that Trump is a complete empty suit when it comes to policy, and contrasting that with the comprehensive and sensible policy agenda laid out by Hillary Clinton who was undoubtedly a real expert when it came to the government decisions that actually impact our lives.  But, instead, you folks at the Times (and most of the rest of the media) focused incessantly on Clinton's perfectly legal use of a private email server, pretending that that was somehow equivalent to the fact that Trump is a dangerous, corrupt, and bigoted con man who is woefully unprepared to be President. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive</a> ",

Trump won by speaking to, and getting out the vote of, that segment of the population not swayed by rational pieces in the NYT or any other members of the \"elite media.\" <br/><br/>Trump is masterful when telling his target audience what it wants to hear. Not surprisingly, the NYT was pleased to hear Trump declare that it \"is a jewel,\" after all those present are human. <br/><br/>The NYT is, and likely will be, the newspaper of record, regardless of what Trump says. It is critical to maintain your high standards. An excellent start would be the flagrant conflict of interest that Trump pretends to be oblivious to. Trump isn't stupid, he knows exactly what he serves his interest. And don't forget his tax returns.",

We've seen several pundits lead with this \"Wait a minute--maybe Trump won't be so bad after all\" revelation.  They're so desperate to find a silver lining that a glint of tin foil from a madman's hat will do.<br/><br/>It's foolish to think that there's anything normal about Donald Trump.  His wild flip-flopping and unpredictability doesn't make him more presidential.  It makes him more dangerous.  It means that he doesn't have a consistent worldview or a moral center.  It means we should worry about the alt-right zealots that surround him, and who will be telling him what he thinks.  And we need to remember who hand picked the zealots.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that a few so-called \"honorable\" Republicans are being tapped to work for a man that they once found repugnant.  People like Ryan and Romney revealed much about their character when they endorsed the 2012 Republican platform, which was little more than Trumpism with Febreze.<br/><br/>It's little comfort that the much-maligned Democrats will still be here to rescue us from yet another destructive, expensive and retrograde Republican presidency.  As long as Trump doesn't do more damage that mere mortals can undo, we'll prosper again.  Maybe we'll levy a tax on everyone who voted for Trump.  That seems fair.",
