				"commentBody": "In California, where I practice criminal defense law, the minimum sentence for a murder conviction as a practical matter is a life sentence. The court can, under limited circumstances, theoretically grant probation, but in a case involving the use of a firearm, even that slim possibility is off the table. It is essentially unheard of for a convicted murderer to not receive a life sentence.<br/><br/>Even criminals know that murder gets you life. I hate to say this, but no wonder South Africa has a huge crime problem. If you could get only six years for killing your girlfriend in California, we would too.<br/><br/>I think it is terribly sad how the court focused on the killer's loss of a good career, and the suffering he has felt. She totally ignored the suffering of the victim's family. This whole thing is a terrible tragedy, and now Mr. Pistorius will soon be back out on the streets, probably in three years. You can do more time in California for a whole long list of crimes, many of them nonviolent.",

Since NASA's budget has been decimated and we can no longer launch an astronaut into space, along with laying off a lot of actual rocket scientists - it's nice to know we are #1 in the world in basketball.  Our sports addicted nation replete with huge coliseums throughout the land gives us much to cheer as our NBA and NFL 'gladiators' battle year round. Our youth wisely look up to these heroes and aspire to follow in their footsteps.  Neil Armstrong is dead.  Long live Lebron James and his well paid journeymen. ",

So, while the northern part of the state (the south) is pretty right-wing, the southern part of the state (the north) will likely determine the outcome.  Unusual paradox.
