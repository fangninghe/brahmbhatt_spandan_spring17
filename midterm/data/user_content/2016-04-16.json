				"commentBody": "I think our country faces a lot of important challenges and Senator Sanders has focused attention on many of them.  He has also energized many young voters and progressives, and hopefully they will get to the polls in November and in 2018, even if Senator Sanders is not the nominee.  <br/><br/>I am not as convinced by his narrative and his solutions.  As an example, mass incarceration started long before the Clinton administration and is a huge problem at the state level.  As another example, the long decline of manufacturing started long before NAFTA, or TPP, or most-favored nation status for China.  As another example, a $15 minimum wage for the entire country (as opposed to a smaller increase or indexing to inflation) would be a disaster for young workers, marginally-skilled workers, students, and part-timers.  As a last example, there is a big difference between making college free versus making college affordable.<br/><br/>Putting aside Senator Sanders, I am troubled by how many of his supporters have decided that Secretary Clinton is untrustworthy (swallowing the Republican line), or corporate, or conservative.  We're talking about a Yale law grad who went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, not some Ivy League millenial who went straight into Wall Street finance to make a fortune.",

				"commentBody": "A perspective I believe has been missing in the Democratic campaign analysis is the way HRC has been pretty much handling Sanders with kid gloves, not attacking him personally. I believe this is because HRC is reasonably confident she will gain the party's nomination and wants to unify the party for the general election. Meanwhile Sanders is going negative, feeding off years of innuendo against HRC's character. <br/><br/>Although current polling suggests Sanders would defeat Trump or Cruz in a general election by a wider margin than Clinton, this is before Sanders has been sufficiently scrutinized by the Right.  We are have already begun to notice Sander's ideas lack credible detail. Do we really believe the Republicans will conduct a general election campaign based on policy debate?  We have already seen the Republicans attack President Obama with dog whistles related to race, religion, socialist associations, etc. Imagine what will be done to Bernie. At least we know HRC's skeletons and she would still defeat any Republican in a general election. Sanders would be fresh meat for the Republicans and they would take the opportunity to impugn his character and identity on multiple levels.   It won't take long for the dog whistles to come out and take the shine off Sanders. I believe the Republicans fear Hillary and are praying for a Bernie upset. Starry-eyed liberals, for whom they hold contempt, seem prepared to deliver their wish.",

				"commentBody": "\"She cheers states like New York that have raised their minimum wage to $15 an hour, as Mr. Sanders wants to do nationally. But she favors a national minimum of only $12, not $15. Why? Her explanation is that a $15 wage could hurt workers in places where wages are generally lower and that the matter should be left to local governments. This contorted position makes her vulnerable to accusations that she\u2019s less than passionate about meeting the needs of low-income families or is being pressured by special interests on the issue.\"<br/>Your criticism of Hillary Clinton's stance on the federal minimum wage is simplistic to the point of dishonest.  There is nothing \"contorted\" about recognizing cost of living varies by region. Clinton favors a $12 FEDERAL minimum BECAUSE that FLOOR has broad support among Democrats in Congress and is a large increase over the current $7.25 minimum.  Lower-cost markets (e.g., Alabama) likely can't get to the price of markets like NY and CA.  If $15 were reasonable number for all states, then NY and CA probably would have gone much higher.  Instead, even CA is phasing in the $15 minimum over seven years -- from $10.50 in 2016 to $15 in 2022.  NY is phasing in the increase to $15 over three years, and that's only in NYC.  It will take longer in the rest of NY state.  I know the NY Times is taking a lot of heat from the Berners in the comments section, but that's no excuse for manufacturing dilemmas to pander to their simplistic point of view. ",

Lots of tiny towns where rents are low in upstate NY, right?<br/><br/>Same with CA. Even though CA has some of the most expensive housing in the country, there are pockets of poverty.<br/><br/>Money is part of our cultural ecosystem. Like all ecosystems, applying a uniform $15 to the whole country would require, yes, that some places have bigger adjustments.<br/><br/>It's not like any state or city has made the min wage $15 immediately. It is still phasing in in Seattle. CA waits until 2022 for $15.<br/><br/>With a uniform country-wide minimum wage, there will be adjustments in the economic climate, some migration for jobs and housing, just as there always have been. but humans working for $15 will have some dignity.<br/><br/>And, I need to keep saying this, no way I will ever vote for Hillary. I will write in Bernie if he does not get the dem nomination, which I think he will, in spite of the NYTimes doing their utmost to stack the deck in favor of Killary.",
