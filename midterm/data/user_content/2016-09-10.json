I say suddenly because she experienced cardiac arrest while undergoing electroshock therapy for the mental issues that plagued the last three years of her life. She passed away three days later.<br/><br/>I was the model of composure until it was just my father, my brother and myself at the funeral home after the service. Then the floodgates opened...heaving, wracking sobs I'd held in for a week.<br/><br/>My partner and I moved to Florida last year and one of the first things we noticed were the number of cardinals hanging around the condo complex. My mom loved cardinals and whenever I see them, which is still almost on a daily basis, I feel like a piece of her is here. I don't believe in God and am not the least bit spiritual, but whatever the reasons, I look out of the back window some days and say a quiet \"Hi Mom\" to them.",

No such requirement is imposed on Mothers.<br/><br/>This is because a woman, who gives her life to her children, gets closer to God that any man, no matter how many prayers he recites.<br/><br/>Many people repudiate traditional Judaism -- and traditional Christianity and Islam and other traditions in general -- because it is allegedly sexist.<br/><br/>However, these traditional outlooks are not meant to denigrate women.  We perceive differences between the genders, but acknowledging differences between men and women is not the same things as demoting women to a lower status.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, who is doing a more useful thing:  A man who composes advertisements for cigarettes, or a woman who lovingly raises her children.<br/><br/>Women who are full time Moms should never be ashamed of their status, and the world around them should celebrate their heroic, selfless stance in life.

Its the very differences between the sexes, most of them based on these ridiculous myths, that still permeate these \"traditional\"(I prefer ancient, or outdated) religions and their practices. Why cant women and men pray together in Judaism or Islam? <br/><br/>Oh...right...the men, they cant think or worship properly with the distraction of females. And of course their God, well...he cant tolerate it either. Its always the females fault men cant think with anything above the waist. And well...there's that female impurity too...all that yucky female stuff...so not suited for spiritual or intellectual pursuits. <br/><br/>There are but a few actual differences (all purely physical, and often even those - outside of reproduction, are not for certain depending on the individuals being compared) between the male and female. But NONE of them have a thing to do with their higher spiritual beliefs, where, and/or how they should pursue them. Religions are by nature, especially those followed \"traditionally\"  sexist!

This is supposed to be a religious place yet people push and shove each other, pee all over the place, and sexually assault women who bend over to tie their shoe laces? Now, I've been to churches, synagogues, and temples and have not been submitted to those types of behaviors. It's amazing how religion can be used to justify everything.",

I never feared sexual assault (harassment in outside streets absolutely, although it was infrequent and less threatening than what I have grown accustomed to in the US) when I visited the Vatican and the great cathedrals of Spain alone two years ago. I hope the Saudi authorities crack down, it is awful women must go through that during one of the most important spiritual experiences of their lives. <br/><br/>I hope you have a wonderful pilgrimage! I am not religious and have not been since my childhood, but still found my trip filled a gap I had long ignored. I hope also that you and other women continue to be frank and open about the issues women face on the Hajj, because only with sunlight will things change. Thank you.",

				"commentBody": "The processing capability of Mecca tops out at about 3 million a year, and that is not without fatalities.  Over 100 years that's 300 million people, out of 1.5 billion Moslems.  So the chances of becoming a Hajji are reasonable, if you're a betting man, but the odds are against.  Over a 70 year life span \"only\" 210 million people will cycle through, so your chance of making it at all is 14%, and less if you exclude early childhood and extreme old age.  It also raises an equity issue if people make the trip more than once.  <br/><br/>If we look at the pilgrimage as a sheer numbers and space problem, with attendant difficulties like providing food, water, and bathroom facilities, you would do what Disneyland does, which is build more facilities.    Limited to one site, you might be able to increase the throughput by streamlining the rituals.      But it is clear that the maximum capacity of the \"physical plant,\" so to speak, has been reached.  ",

The reporter is right there, in the heart of the greatest spiritual place, where prophet Abraham built the first place of monotheistic worship, where the last prophet, Muhammad, was born, and yet, she completely misses out on the meaning of surrending to the absolute love from God in this very spot on earth where believers are asked to travel. If she does not have that light inside, well she'd better off at home indeed.",

Some may feel a difference the moment they embark on Hajj, many others feel it at end of their pilgrimage. I've known several people who didn't feel much in Makkah - partly because of the tough environment and heightened expectations - but underwent a transformation within the peace and serenity of Medina. Still many come and go feeling the same, but only reflect upon their experience years later. A lot of it has to do with who a person accompanies - generally the more focused the group on pilgrimage itself, the more lasting the effects.<br/><br/>As for this reporter, I can understand why she feels they way she describes. Journalists, by virtue of their profession, are skeptics and critical. Having been raised a muslim exposed to liberal secular values, it can become difficult to reconcile the conflicting sets of values.",
