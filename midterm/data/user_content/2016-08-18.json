				"commentBody": "Any true fiscal conservative understands the basic principle that keeps insurance solvent: largest risk pool.This means everybody in. It can't be voluntary; rugged individualists &amp; foolish youth say they don't want to be forced to buy something. The healthcare system is mandated to provide free care to anyone who gets to the ER with acute illness. FREE. After a car accident, pneumonia, cancer, toxic exposure,et al.When people are uninsured, their free care cost is shifted to those who pay premiums or to hospital losses.No other commodity is required to be given for free; health care must not be likened to something we choose to buy.<br/> Nobody expects to get sick or get rear-ended or fall from a ladder or slip on the ice. It happens. Medicare can be expanded gradually, with a buy in at age 60, then 55, etc. Eventually, everyone will have a premium (or subsidy) mandated just as Medicare is funded now.<br/>This lowers over head from the private market's 40% admin/marketing (with CEO's getting millions) and provides economies of scale (lower medication costs, etc). It can send money though existing private entities like Blue Cross &amp; Kaiser or remain like current Medicare fee-for-service.<br/>Health savings accts, tax breaks and interstate marketing (the Trump/GOP solution) is like arranging the chairs on the deck of the Titanic !<br/>Universal health insurance will also eventually lower total costs as preventable conditions can be treated early. It's the only realistic long term solution.",

I think I know what you mean when you mention a capitalized \"Open Borders;\" Trumpian for immigrants, right?<br/><br/>Perhaps if the Republicans would have worked with the Dems on the healthcare law, especially since this \"Obamacare\" is nothing more than a revised version of the early 1990s plan Republicans were pushing and that Romney adapted and adopted for Massachusetts,  then this plan might have been more wisely thought out and not rushed through. The American Public, as you give them a capitalized title, was desperate for a plan to cut down onerous healthcare costs, and didn't get a public option or single-payer. What they got was a cobbled-together piece of legislation that in reality is the fault of both parties. If the Republicans would have worked with Obama and the Dems, instead of obstructing from Day One of Obama's term starting with McConnell's shameful meeting that day, just maybe we'd have a smoothly functioning plan in place. This is on the GOP leadership every bit as much as it is on the Dems.<br/><br/>So, if you don't want single-payer, what is your plan? It's easy to be petulant and say what you don't want, but not having your own plan when you obstruct somebody else's idea is just as bad. The Republicans \"public option\" from the beginning has not been \"to repeal and replace.\" No, just \"repeal.\"",

				"commentBody": "Totally agree with all the comments that the time is right for single payer. And the beauty is that the current presidential campaign provides a wonderful opportunity for Hillary to take up the cudgel.<br/><br/>The angry white working class voters who make up a large chunk of Trump's supporters are some of the foremost victims of our horrible health insurance system. They make too much for Medicare but not enough so that health care costs aren't crushing. While I'm under no illusion that many won't vote against their economic self-interest, regardless, the pain is too great for all of them to ignore it. I'd bet Hillary could peel off a lot of their votes if she recognized their plight and offered a solution.<br/><br/>Come-on Hillary! Make single-payer health insurance a centerpiece of your campaign. The time is right!   ",

Very little, if any, surface and sub-surface coal extracted in TN, KY, WV goes to create energy in these same states.  So why is this, you ask?  Because the coal extracted is not clean coal, and the mining operations are all private sector.  So where do these same states get the clean coal to burn in their power plants, you ask?  Answer:  from the western states, through TVA, whose mining operations are owned by...you guessed it!  The federal government!  The states have no control over and cannot prevent the feds from pricing the private sector out of the mining industries.  And this article has the temerity to ask who should pick up the pieces.
