				"commentBody": "Hastert is apparently a devout, born again Christian who prays a lot. Perhaps the problem is internal to some currents in Christianity, especially the doctrine of sola fide, \"by faith alone,\" which allows the sinner to say: \"I have sinned, but I have a strong faith that God loves me and will forgive my sins. That is all that matters.\"<br/><br/>Hastert probably realizes he has committed grave sins, but his faith in God's forgiveness allows him - according to sola fide - an easy way out.",

I sure don't remember her having anything to say or do about Viet Nam, I don't recall her even being known at the time. <br/><br/>As for Serbia, would have just let Radovan Karadzic continue as he was. I do not recall the U.S. killing civilians, should those massacres have been allowed to continue? Yemen, can you provide evidence? <br/><br/>Following you lead we should become isolationists, just like many wanted before WWll. I do agree Vie Nam was a disaster, but it was not Clinton's doing, it was the Dulles brothers, just like Iran. Yes Clinton is not afraid to take on some very difficult issues, but we an not stick our heads in the sand and at like they do not exist.<br/><br/>As for Trump, he wants to start trade wars with China and a currency war with Mexico. Beside sealing off the border which work two ways. Some of us like to go fishing in Cabo, or surfing in Baha among other places, and many Mexicans come here to buy goods. But a trade war with China, they can break our banks. They can flood the world with cheap goods, undercut our prices on machine tools, just about anything we sell abroad, and we go broke in a hurry.

As a bookseller, I talked many customers OUT of this terrible book. <br/><br/>It's horrifyingly illustrated, and would give most children raised on Disney graphics nightmares. I can only assume that the photographer that took the accompanying photo agrees, since we can't see the cover.<br/><br/>The book is also unusually long, given that it's for small children. It takes over 40 minutes to read, and honestly you could read the Wall Street Journal to your children for 40 minutes and get the same results -- nightmares included. If there's anything hypnotic about it, it's the fact that this charlatan of an author has convinced desperate parents to buy his sleeping snake-oil.<br/><br/>Reading a classic children's book like The Secret Garden or The Five Children and It for 40 minutes a night will prove soporific and educational, and keep your hard-earned money out of this hoax of an author's pockets.",

I tell them the truth, that times have changed, that when I was their age, women didn't have the opportunities they have today, so they should set their sights as high as they want because in today's America they can be a SC judge, a doctor, a scientist, a CEO, a company founder, a self-made millionaire, and even the POTUS.  I tell them that the world isn't perfect, however, and that equality still has a ways to go. I also tell them that we can legislate discrimination out of the government and the workplace, but not from our culture; it takes longer and a lot more skill to do that. Changing attitudes for the better requires mature thought and action. Vilifying people who don't agree with you, becoming strident and bitter, acting self-righteous and arrogant, are behaviors that cannot bring about positive change. The rise of Trump is evidence of a backlash, that changing culture through bullying PC'ism doesn't work. Assuming that Trump supporters are categorically ignorant sexists, for example, is counterproductive and certainly false. (To save the reactionaries some time, I will disclose that I have never voted for a Republican, nor am I a Trump supporter.)",

Hillary Clinton had a modest middle-class upbringing. She was a diligent, outstanding student. She worked hard to get into an Ivy League college and graduate from Yale Law School. Early in her career she distinguished herself by working on issues such as civil rights, the well-being of women and children, education, and health care.  She was twice elected Senator of New York. Barack Obama appointed her to be Secretary of State, and I'm sure that her intelligence and knowledge of foreign affairs were critical elements in his decision. I can't think of any other First Lady except Eleanor Roosevelt who has had the distinguished career that Hillary Clinton has had. And it's because of her own intelligence, diligence, dedication, focus, strength, guts, and hard work that she has earned the stature that she has.",

The births that lead to problems do NOT happen in the \"blink\" of an eye.  Instead of the baby proceeding easily down through the birth canal, problems arise when the baby \"gets hung up.\"<br/><br/>Babies can twist around into what are called \"undeliverable\" positions.\"  Instead of the top of the baby's head presenting through the cervix, it may be the shoulder or one leg.  Labor stops--does not progress. Since all certified midwives are close to hospitals one has time to get the woman and baby in for a c-section.  <br/><br/>This is why we keep evaluating the mother and baby in pre-natal checks as frequently as every week in the last four weeks of delivery.

I don't know what the \"even\" in \"even men do this\" is for. Of course, men do this. That's the main reason some of them used to be supportive of Sarah Palin. The difference is that attractive men tend to retain their attractiveness to woman at a greater age than attractive women retain their attractiveness to men (also genetically programmed: older woman can't procreate; older men can), and presidents tend to be fairly aged.",

After all, we only have two parties.<br/><br/>So the Democrats obviously have control of the White House (forever) and Congress (both Houses) and every Governorship in the 50 states.<br/><br/>Except....NOT. The GOP holds majorities in both houses of Congress and 2/3rds of all Governorships.<br/><br/>You can't do that with only 1/3 of the voters, so you are misinterpreting statistics here.",
