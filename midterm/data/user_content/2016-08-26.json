				"commentBody": "Hillary Clinton won because of the super-delegates who were predetermined to vote for her.Removing the super-delegates would have made the race for the nomination much closer.  Then we had the biased leanings from the DNC for Hillary Clinton, and against Bernie Sanders.<br/><br/>As for Hillary Clinton, the e-mails that were released show the Clinton Foundation and her position of Secretary-of-State were not so separate. People asked and sometimes met with government people if they donated enough to the Clinton Foundation. Of course, there was nothing wrong with this, compared to a president if he/she did the same thing. Then there was Benghazi, her private server, deleted e-mails, and a few other issues.<br/><br/>This year, I found that there were few candidates running for the Presidency from the Democrats. Had there been more, perhaps there would have been someone better.I'm also tired of reading Trump-bashing (though deservedly so) from Hillary Clinton.<br/>And I would like to hear from Hillary Clinton on her points-of-view on the issues, and her policies if she gets elected. <br/><br/>I think that Physicist meant  \"the country deserves better\" with some of the \"issues\" that I brought up.",

				"commentBody": "I stood with thousands of other Colombians last night in the Parque de los Hippies (Hippie's Park) in Bogot\u00e1 and watched the live transmission from Havana announcing the final peace accord. <br/><br/>Through tears, I listened as the Cuban and Norwegian facilitators, and then the heads of the Colombian and FARC negotiating teams, all spoke. My body shivered when they announced that the country's long war was over. The FARC will hand over arms to a special U.N. Verification Team and that the government will help facilitate the FARC's transition to a political movement without arms.  <br/><br/>Bogot\u00e1 at dusk is brisk as the sun falls behind the mountains just a block to the east of Hippie's Park. And yet the crowd was electric, regularly breaking out in chants \"S\u00ed se pudo\" (yes we could end the war!)  <br/><br/>I listened as an accord for transitional justice was announced providing a necessary balance between justice and peace. Mr. Vivanco of Human Rights Watch, cited in your article, is simply mistaken when he charges that the accord will promote impunity. Few Colombian or int'l rights defenders would agree with him. <br/><br/>I listened as accords were announced for land, participation, substitution of illegal crops and other issues related to disarmament and reintegration were described.<br/><br/>Some, like former president Alvaro Uribe, are encouraging people to vote no in the upcoming plebiscite. Uribe is increasingly isolated. I am convinced that the country will vote yes, for peace. We have had enough war.",

				"commentBody": "@ Jesse Marioneaux<br/>Thanks for your kind thoughts but let me clarify.  This war was not principally about drugs. I know the US media often presented it as such, but the conflict has roots that go back 70 years, well before the emergence of the drug trade. <br/><br/>It is true that since the 1980s, the drug trade greatly affected the war, providing resources to armed actors, corrupting institutions, and distorting elements of the economy. But throughout the war was principally about political, social and economic exclusion and oppression of many of the most marginalized and least enfranchised sectors of society.  <br/><br/>Many in the country long to open up sufficient democratic space so that the country's diverse populations, including Indigenous, Afro-Colombians, mestizos, peasants, laborers, and others can participate without being killed, threatened or marginalized.  This is the promise of the peace accords which will direct special investments in the countryside and will provide protections for minority and marginal political actors, including the former guerrillas.<br/><br/>Constructing peace will not be easy. But the accords have opened the door for our country to begin to construct a state and society without recourse to violence.  ",

				"commentBody": "The announcement of an arrival to a peace agreement by the government of Colombia and the leftist guerrillas or FARC, is a welcome news that brings finally long awaited hopes for the end of the longest lasting armed conflict in the Americas and probably elsewhere. This has been a war of attrition in which there has been no victors, but where the main losers as been the innocent civilians caught in the middle. The agreement still needs to be submitted to a national referendum for final approval, but there seems to be a certain reluctance to go along with the deal by a certain segments of the population, mainly in the basis of resentment toward the FARC's past means of conducting their war anti government activities. But let's not forget that there were also paramilitary forces, that were lose cannon, acting on their own and somewhat overlooked by the government itself. It is time to embrace the peace Effort by all Colombians and brig long lasting stability to this beautiful country.",

And yes, there are many benefits the Colombian government has to grant FARC in order to built trust from previous (failed) attempts to reach peace without violence. In addition, paramilitary leaders where extradited because of the imminent threat they posed to incumbent politicians (such as the ex president Alvaro Uribe), as they were willing to disclose their political-military links. The moral here is that reneging current agreements in the present will imply even more costly peace processes in the future. Between the two evils it is always better to choose the lesser one.",

The FARC\u2019s lack of respect for their victims, their lack of repentance, their arrogance, and their refusal to commit to not repeating their heinous crimes creates nothing but scorn and skepticism.  And that theory that paramilitaries were extradited to keep them silent is not accurate; the fact is they did speak from their cells \u2013wherever on earth they were imprisoned- but none of their accusations against Uribe have ever been proven true.  Having my roots in Colombia I would like nothing but peace in that country \u2013actually, I want to see peace in the ENTIRE world- but I am afraid that the present agreement, with its lack of justice will only contribute to extending in a different manner what has already been a half-century long conflict, in which the biggest loser has been and always will be the everyday citizen.  As MLK wisely said it: no justice, no peace\u2026I just hope that time proves my skepticism wrong.",

It seems the alerts were meaningful though it is not known  whether  the alert could be used. ",

The chaos, the desperation to save lives, the attempts to restore power and stop fires. In cities like Portland or Seattle where many buildings, schools and infrastructure were not built for magnitude 9.0 temblors, will probably far exceed Amatrice and may be the worst natural disaster in American history.<br/><br/>What amazes me is the lax attitude by politicians. In some cases buildings are being erected in some of the worst land areas like in tsunami zones on the Oregon coast. What will it take to change this do-little attitude? Suggestions?",

Unfortunately, humans need frequent reminders to prepare for disasters. Growing up in Tokyo, I experienced countless earthquakes but was never worried by them: even as a child I knew that building codes were more than adequate, and that large-scale emergency drills were held frequently. Now I live in Los Angeles, where citizens are expected to fend for themselves for up to two weeks after an earthquake. While I don't think everyone has laid in enough food and water to make it that long, most of us have some supplies and no one is in denial.",
