				"commentBody": "Growing affluence, the rise of the man in the gray flannel suit, success in succeeding generations of well trained bureaucrats, has given to many the ability to live distant from family. The poor often never leave town. They never travel. Their more successful neighbors move on. We see this in The North Country. Children with good grades and discipline leave. They do not smoke, they do not drink. They study and make rational decisions. The extended family was often a function of farming, the successful family farm, not affluence. We Americans have shattered ethical farming in favor of something quite different, and obesity is but one result. Our corporate loving government is deeply involved with shattering good food and the families that made it. We are told 80 to 90% of the nation lived on the farm in 1900. Today, it is less than 1%. And 40% are rejected by the military for obesity. That cohort are our least, not our wealthy, for they are seeking a form of stability. They are rarely the mythical patriot that wants to save us from the Axis Powers of WW II. We have a lot of thinking to do. Homelessness is an indicator of who we have become - and where we are going. Single parents, unwed mothers, girls with children from more than one male, these folks are heading for trouble. Who said this is the way to go? Children raising children is apt. We are so disrespectful. Who puts the interest of the child first? Most described are from broken marriages. It starts with the family. ",

				"commentBody": "I am very sad about the gorilla (from the video it appeared he was probably trying to help the child). But I totally refuse to judge the parents: unless you've walked in their shoes, don't claim you would never, ever lose track of an adventurous child for a millisecond - and a millisecond can be all it takes for disaster to strike.<br/><br/>It doesn't even have to be THAT kind of child. I raised a boy who was not particularly adventurous, at least, not any more so than most boys and many girls. (Though he did have a nerve-wracking _climbing_ phase.)<br/><br/>We lost him once for about 15 minutes in a very crowded public place. My heart starts to pound even now, thinking about it - 18 years later. It was the stereotypical case of \"looked away for 6 seconds - gone.\" Both my husband and I were inches from him; my husband was right next to him, and I had backed away a few feet to take his picture, and he was .... just not there anymore. It took literally MOMENTS for him to be swept away in a crowd of moving people. Long story short, we found him in a few minutes, but it was the most harrowing 15 minutes of my life. I knew neither of us had not done anything wrong; neither of us had been inattentive in any way, we were practically joined to that kid at the hip and he slipped out of our control and our vision and was gone LIKE THAT.<br/><br/>Raising a child safely to adulthood is a great good fortune. You have to be attentive but you also have to be LUCKY.",

The gorilla was the alpha male of the troop and alpha males will often fling around objects (sticks or other objects) to demonstrate their status and dominance.<br/><br/>From the gorilla's perspective, the crowd was probably seen as threatening, especially in the heightened emotional state it was in.  The boy smelled like the crowd and the amount of pheromones in the air communicating a fight or flight reaction would have been palpable to the gorilla.  He would have thrashed the boy's body to demonstrate his dominance, status and defense of his troop.<br/><br/>Make no mistakes, an adult silverback gorilla is a dangerous, dangerous animal.  They weigh 400 pounds and are as strong as 10 adults.  An NFL lineman in top physical condition would have been flung around like a rag doll.",

				"commentBody": "It's tragic; no point in trying to assign blame. I can't help but think, though, that this event is a symptom of the way society's attitudes about child behavior have changed. There seems to be much greater tolerance, for example, of kids climbing all over restaurant booths, running amok in store aisles, and shrieking when they don't get their way. Seems that kids who have been taught to sit still, be quiet, and take no for an answer are in an ever-dwindling minority. Considering how much this type of behavior (or lack thereof)  is exhibited in classrooms, it's a wonder teachers are able to teach anything. Again, no blame in the zoo incident -- except maybe toward folks spewing invective -- but maybe we can use such a horrific event to revisit the notion of decorum and what type of behavior is acceptable in public. And then maybe Harambe won't have died in vain.",

The parents and their son returned back from an outing. Wife went to open the car garage and the husband was at the wheel. Son slowly slipped out without notice and was at the rear side of the car. It was his father's blind spot and unfortunate fatal mishap occurred while reversing the car into the garage. I simply can't image the state of mind of the hapless parents.

							"commentBody": "A 3yo child is not responsible or his actions in the same way an adult is. They don't have the cognitive ability to understand cause and effect, nor is intent judged the same way. 3yos cannot make predictions based on experience and facts the way adults can. So, when a 3yo slips his guardians, that is an accident. Everything that happens afterwards continues to be an accident, whether or not the child jumps into the enclosure or falls.<br/><br/>And every 3yo child has had a guardian look away for the split second it would take for the child to slip away. I'd place Vegas money on that. I've seen the most calm and lucid child do the most unexpected things, and again, I'd bet every parent or guardian of a toddler has said at one time or another, \"I had no idea the child would have done _____.\" Spirited child or no. <br/><br/>Also, little kids say crazy things from the moment they wake up. This kid could have been saying, \"I want to pet the lions, I want to ride the giraffes, I'm going to go hug the otters.\" Kids will say, \"I will never go near the pool, Mommy\" and then end up drowning minutes later. 3yos are not reliable sources for predicting their own behavior. Parents need to make judgment calls, and entering a zoo--where, according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, visitors to zoos are primary women/mothers and 2 out of every 3 visitors has a child with them--the expectation is a level of child safety knowing that any kid is capable of losing control; barriers need to be better.",
