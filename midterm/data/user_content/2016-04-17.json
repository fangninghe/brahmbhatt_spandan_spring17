				"commentBody": "Actually, erm \u2026 I, though a Democrat, watched all three of these Republican family town halls, and am utterly embarrassed to say that I was impressed by the Trump family. I don't know what I was expecting, but I kept having to tamp down the response \"well, he must not be as terrible as I thought, they seemed to have turned out fine.\" A family, in a \"Dallas\" or \"Dynasty\" kind of way. Well-prepared, but affable. Plus there was a moment when Trump and Melania exchanged a smile that felt like the brief, passing public intimacy of a real couple.<br/><br/>And the Kasichs: Mrs. Kasich reminded me of several go-get-'em Midwestern moms I encountered during my daughter's public-school years. The two girls were annoyingly/refreshingly normal (annoying in saying \"like\" every other word, as my own did at that age) and not smothered by coaching. Didn't seem like a perpetual power struggle going on. Neither Trump nor Kasich dominated or overshadowed their families. <br/><br/>But the Cruz family: ick! I still haven't had enough showers to wash away this image: \"we have something of a game where to get a hug and kiss from the girls, I usually have to do about four laps chasing them in the living room. And one will go one way and one will go the other way, and I have to tackle them. They usually get their good night hugs hanging upside down by their feet. And it's -- we have fun.\" Said in his nasally reptilian way. It all felt cold and rehearsed to death, with Ted being controlling and dominant.",

				"commentBody": "If the concern is to push for food that causes less harm to everyone, human, animal and bird, there is little option other than educating the public on the merits of  vegetarianism.  <br/><br/>In fact we Hindus strongly believe that the human feelings and whole nature  becomes blunted by association with butchering of animals and people will find it extremely difficult to govern animal passion violent nature and restless condition. It is for this very reason vegetarianism is strongly linked with Indic religions that originated in ancient India.<br/><br/>Indic religious (Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism) philosophical schools  forbid consumption of meat and Jainism institutes an outright ban on the same. Consequently, India is home to more vegetarians than any other country. About 30% of India's 1.2 billion population practices lacto vegetarianism.<br/><br/>Every act by which a person directly or indirectly supports killing or injury is seen as violence, which creates harmful karma, a spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).  The aim of ahimsa is to prevent the accumulation of such karma.<br/><br/>Jains consider nonviolence to be the most essential religious duty for everyone. Their scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity. ",

				"commentBody": "(Yesterday's thread is already very long.)<br/>Continuing, re: PHALANGE.<br/><br/>Leapy and David,<br/><br/>What exactly is you point?  You would reject a puzzle because it uses a word that dictionaries accept -- even the abridged M-W desk dictionary, <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/phalange\" title=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/phalange\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/phalange</a> -- and has been used by Margaret Farrar as well as Will Shortz?<br/><br/>If a clue had \"phalange,\" it would be a no-brainer to change it the preferable \"phalanx.\"  But we're not talking about a clue.  An entry means rewriting, or deep-sixing, the puzzle.  Why?  Because the word is a back-formation from the plural that's only been used for 350 years?  <br/><br/>I don't say \"phalange.\"  I don't say \"bicep\" (which irks me even more).  But other people do, and have for a long time.  It's a word and I don't see why an entire puzzle should be shot because it used it.",

Benson, 15 April post<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Benson, <br/><br/>Interesting information; thanks for sharing it with us. <br/><br/>There is a massive array of wind turbines southeast of Kingfisher, Oklahoma. I go by there now and then. <br/><br/>On Christmas Day, about 10:30a.m., I cruised by and saw that none of the turbine blades were turning.<br/><br/> Not enough wind. <br/><br/>I went by yesterday, again about 10:30 a.m. That day there was a lot of wind, probably 15-20 mph, gusting 25 perhaps. Not unusual for an April day in Oklahoma. The \"wind comes sweepin' down the plains\", as the song says, quite a bit in these parts. <br/><br/>None of the turbine blades were turning. They were feathered. <br/><br/>Too much wind. <br/><br/>So I guess wind turbines will make power but there mustn't be too much wind, and there mustn't be too little.<br/><br/>Sort of a Goldilocks technology. <br/><br/>Makes me wonder if wind power is really ready to serve as the primary motive force for an advanced industrial civilization.
