He is in charge of one of the finest combined men's and women's tournaments on the tour, yet he feels this way? He cannot stay in his position with that kind of appalling lack of judgment, apology notwithstanding. Statements have consequences.",

Instead of attempting to establish that the women's game is currently on par with the men, it shows a photo of Chris and Martina from decades ago, as if to admit that the women are below par now, but defending on the grounds that men once were too. But the man wasn't talking about the past, only about the present. Can a reasoned argument be made that the women's game is as compelling as the men's right now? If so it certainly wasn't in this article.  And meanwhile, demanding equal pay the women do not demand to play matches of equal length, meaning the men can often deliver much more bang for the buck than the women.",

				"commentBody": "Obviously this guy should be fired.  A tournament director should never say such things about his sport.  I imagine that this will be arranged.<br/><br/>However, crudely he says it, there is a correct point underneath.  There is women's soccer and women's basketball, whose athlete do not get even 10% of the men's sports.  But they do not play in co-ed tournaments, where women can flat negotiate for equal everything.<br/><br/>I regret that other women's sports get such mammoth disrespect.  They deserve better.  However, in tennis, they get too much.  Women's matches get less TV viewership, fewer on-court viewers and, at Grand Slam tournaments, provide less entertainment hours.  Those are the currency of entertainment remuneration!<br/><br/>If tournaments were purely separate for tennis, as they are for other sports, women would be grossly underpaid in tennis too.  I love to watch women's tennis -- I would rather they be overpaid than underpaid.",

				"commentBody": "I felt like I'd seen this episode a million times before what with the coke meltdown and hallucination of a dead guy as the BFF.  <br/><br/>A shame Scorsese attached himself to this - a boring retread of so many of his favorite tropes.  Jagger?  Did Jagger actually observe anything interesting about the record business or was he above it all?<br/><br/>This show is all style and nothing else.  And as we know, 70s style was gaudy, trashy, no substance.  The show has no substance.<br/><br/>Lastly, the actor playing Bowie was far too big and heavy to play that part. David Bowie was always a lithe, thin elegant man and weighed even less during drug-fueled 70s.  Does whoever is casting this terrible show care whether the actors cast as famous people are remotely credible?  This episode reminded me of how great David Bowie himself was playing Warhol in Julian Schnabel's \"Basquiat.\"  Schnabel is a great filmmaker.  Maybe HBO should give Schnabel a contract to develop a series..... ",

She originally bought into Phillip as a member of some US security bureau checking up on  the FBI but now she must realize that story is no longer even slightly plausible.
