And that Sanders is winning the states Dems need to win in November, and outpolling her dramatically among independents everywhere? Still think she's most \"electable\"?<br/><br/>The comment that Clinton had seemed to have locked up the Democratic race last Tuesday is laughable now, but it was also way out of line last week. The idea that superdelegates will stay with Clinton if she falls measurably behind in the popular vote is very questionable. Adding them now to her delegate total makes sense if you're trying to create a perception of inevitability for the candidate you've endorsed. Wake up, Times analysts. She's not inevitable any more than she was in 2008.",

It makes Bernie's situation seem dire, while it really isn't at all.<br/><br/>For the record, as of Wednesday March 9th, Hillary has 760 pledged delegates to Bernie's 546 pledged delegates, a substantial lead but hardly insuperable. Hers come almost entirely from states no Democrat can win in November, while Bernie's come from states Democrats must win in November.  Hillary does well with demographics that always lean Democratic, while Bernie excels with independents and younger voters, who can go either way. The 461 unpledged \"super delegates\" -- the party establishment -- can vote for either candidate at convention time. <br/><br/>If Bernie can win a few more big, traditionally Democratic states -- New York and California spring to mind -- and comes into the convention with momentum... Hmmmm....<br/><br/>Well, I guess the Democrats, in that case, could choose self-destruction and insist on Hillary, or they could go for a Bernie-led progressive landslide that just might lead to a Democratic Congress. <br/><br/>Not Impossible.

That is accurate, up to a point: Clinton has triumphed in the South due to strong black support, tonight in Mississippi (where she took all demographic groups) and in Louisiana over the weekend.<br/><br/>But the Times fails to point out that Sanders is outperforming Clinton in other regions as shown by his wins in Kansas, Nebraska, Maine and Michigan. Sanders is also making inroads among minorities.  A Washington Post analysis of the Michigan results concludes that although Clinton won Michigan's black vote by 20 points, she dominated less strongly than expected.  As a result, she lost the state.  <br/><br/>The Times also fails to mention that Sanders overcame significant polling deficits to win Michigan, a sign that he is gaining momentum.<br/><br/>Is it possible that Clinton's deficits in the Midwest, in the North and among white voters will prove to be a weakness?  Unfortunately, the Times does not even raise that possibility for its readers.",

The upper midwest has been decimated by offshoring.  That message rings true to the voters.  They have suffered terribly from factory closings.<br/><br/>Bernie's stand on the gun issue is a brilliant move.  The upper midwest, Kansas and Missouri included, have large numbers of hunters.  I have known many who like to go hunting.  These people do not walk around with pistols or hoard assault weapons.  They often keep their rifles locked in gun safes.  Hunting is a family and community tradition.  The NRA does not represent them.  All they want is to be left alone.  Bernie's position is viewed by them as \"reasonable\".  That is music to their ears.  <br/><br/>Once out of the deep south, Bernie should keep racking up wins.  He could win Ohio.  He could win in Missouri.  Next Tuesday, I'll get to cast my ballot.  <br/><br/>The western states should also go for him as well as the big northeast states also. <br/><br/>Trump will win the GOP, no question.  Bernie has always polled better than Hillary against Trump.  <br/><br/>We have ourselves a real race!  This is exciting and just the thing to wake up the electorate and get people to go to the polls in Nov.  <br/><br/>The old rules no longer apply.  We are all fed up, both left and right.
