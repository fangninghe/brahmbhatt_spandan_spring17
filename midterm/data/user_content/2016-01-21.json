				"commentBody": "The issue is the relationship of the uplift cost of oil to the price it can be sold for.  As jburnich commented, the \"easy oil\" is declining in availability.  Many of the newer wells have an uplift cost well in excess of what the costs were in the 1990s.  If the price continues to drop, the more costly wells will be capped.  Uplift costs in Saudi Arabia average around $10, so it is to the Saudi's benefit to keep producing as that helps its national budget (but the benefit is far less than before due the price decline).<br/><br/>The high cost of crude in 2008 was caused in part by \"paper oil,\" traders who neither produced nor consumed crude and were purely speculators.  Changes in regulation and exchange rules have greatly reduced the level of paper oil traded.  That is one, but not the only, reason for the decline in the price of oil.  A major factor today, as noted by others here, is a significant and continuing excess of crude production over consumption.",

That may be a nice solution for people seeking retribution, but it doesn't do much to purify the water in Flint, Michigan. There also is a petition asking the City not to terminate water service to people who are delinquent in paying their water bills. That doesn't help anything either. What should occur is a movement to have all the people of Flint stop paying their water bills, and leave the City without any revenue for its water utility. It is absolutely criminal to ask people to pay for the delivery of toxic water they can only use to poison themselves and their children. If citizens shut off all water and stop paying for it, people in Flint will be surprised how fast the problem will get fixed. The money saved can be used to buy and distribute purified water; and many other related solutions are possible. Paying the City for poisoned water constitutes consent to municipal extortion, and condones the criminal conduct of those responsible for contaminating the water. <br/><br/>Ed Spievack",

What someone can afford depends upon a combination of family income and family wealth. The only way to have accurate data is to tax both income and wealth. Taxing wealth becomes practical and fair only if it is done inversely. Consider a choice of income rates between 8% and 28% paired with a net wealth tax of 2% descending to zero. One formula provides the same choice for rich, middle class and poor. The one-page tax form would also supply accurate data for a needs based Public Care system. <br/><br/>Private insurance would be competitive as Public Care fees increase based on higher personal income and wealth. The more one has at risk the more one is likely to purchase health insurance \u2013 and that is the way all insurance should work. Health insurers should set rates on real costs for real services for real people. Health insurers should not be forced to equalize rates for young and old, men and women and those with extraordinary health conditions.<br/><br/>To sweeten the pie for providers, the government would guarantee full and easy payment to providers that accepted a fair share of Public Care patents. To help insurers, all prescription drugs would be free (reducing the cost of insurance).",

As it has done before the Saudi's and OPEC are engaging in economic warfare against the United States, and the world economy.  Trillions of dollars have disappeared from the world's stock markets.

In  pursuit of their objective of maintaining their world oil market share the Saudi's have demonstrated a disregard even for the needs of fellow OPEC members.<br/>   No country has attempted to counter their behavior. One way would be to impose an import tax on every barrel of OPEC oil of fifty dollars.  That would put a halt to their excess production, and at the same time raise the price of our shale produced oil to a profitable level.  That would save many banks loan losses, and enable our oil producers to avoid bankruptcy.",

In a perfect world, the Saudis would lose so much money they'd be unable to continue funding ISIS in their proxy war with Iran - and when Iranian production comes back online, that war is going to heat up.",

For years there have been stories in the financial press that oil storage capacity is maxed out, and that energy producers were unwilling to stop producing even though they were running out of a place to put the stuff.  Our own over-production, along with Saudi Arabia's intention to maintain market share in spite of dropping prices, and Iran (with the world's 5th largest reserves) preparing to come on-line, created this oil price situation.",
