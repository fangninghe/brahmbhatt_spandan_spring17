LGBTQ rights? As little as three years ago she didn't want gay marriage. Wall street? She gets absurd sums of money simply to give them speeches, and says she'll only release them to the public after the remaining candidates release theirs (including the Republicans, which she knows quite well will never happen). <br/><br/>We see Sanders as the United States' best chance to \"catch up\" with the rest of the world by offering things like universal healthcare and tuition-free college, or at the very least bringing that discussion to the table.

				"commentBody": "Casting black and Latino actors as the founders seems rather derivative to me of Quentin Tarantino and his historical dreamscapes in which the deserving finally get their comeuppances at the hands of those whom they mistreated. But which is the more dramatic statement? A multi-ethnic American founders generation or \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d? Or \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d? Frankly, for what-might-have-beens I\u2019ll take Tarantino.<br/><br/>Alexander Hamilton was one of the most conflicted of our founders, a man of raging ambitions and not-very-subtle and just as raging insecurities rising from his low birth amid a group of landed grandees who were more central founders \u2013 and he was very young indeed during the Revolution (21 in 1776). His anti-slavery stance was about as energetic as he could away with in an early Republic that was so dominated by the South while he was still alive, under Washington and Jefferson; and that energy was far more nuanced and intellectual than the play is said to communicate. I haven\u2019t seen it yet, and don\u2019t know that I will \u2013 I probably know too much about Hamilton to really enjoy it.<br/><br/>The best treatment I\u2019ve ever seen of Hamilton was Gore Vidal\u2019s, a fictional but pretty well-researched one in the historical flashbacks we were offered in \u201cBurr\u201d. Not a lot about black and Latino co-founders came through in THAT character treatment. However, if this spectacle gets our kids and even adults excited about American history, I\u2019m all for it, historical pedantry aside.",

Me, I am rather delighted you probably won't see it, not because you know so much about Hamilton -- I assure you that every night there are many who know more while also having the capacity to enjoy a work of genius and joy and classic tragedy -- but because it would be such a shame to waste a seat on someone who already knows [sic] he'll take Tarantino over the topic of the day that he has not even seen.

He alone is so handsome, articulate &amp; charming that no doubt it has an effect on audiences. The show is tremendous theatre. But I believe much of the enthusiasm is for this \"multi-culti\" version of US History, that dovetails neatly with lefty liberal ideals -- wouldn't it have been super if our Founding Fathers were perfectly mixed group of all races? if the only bad guy was a WHITE king?<br/><br/>A kid who gets excited by this, THEN finds out that the real Alexander Hamilton was just another WASPy white guy, is going to have a major disappointment. And lose interest ASAP.<br/><br/>The analogy of Tarantino films is apt. If you saw those at a formative age, without much background (US schools do an especially abysmal job of teaching history) and THEN later found out that gee, apparently the Jews did NOT rise up to revengefully murder their Nazi oppressors....and gee, handsome escaped slaves did not return to the Plantation &amp; summarily execute the slaveowners &amp; their families in bloodbaths (with the help of some random German dude, couldn't even figure that one out myself). Indeed, had some Jewish European in 1943 -- or some black slave -- remotely done even one killing like this, they'd have been dead; tortured, gassed or lynched. Gee, not a fun story at all.",

Unlike tennis when the men and women play roughly at the same time at major championships (so marketing dollars for instance cannot be distinguished), the men and women play at different times, so there  should be no major obstacle to getting up two separate books.

The banks need their reform and non-financial institutions, like Met-Life, that have a big influence on the economy and the financial sector need theirs.<br/><br/>As for the contention that financial crises are rare, I disagree. Since the repeal of Glass-Steagall in the 1990's, we've been in a loop of worsening financial bubbles. Larry Summers has been warning about Secular Stagnation for the past two years and you have agreed with him since he began talking about it. Summers recently picked up on an Economist piece to renew the conversation on the topic of a new recession, too much Wall Street profit, and jobs. That threat is real and few are the US economists who have been writing about it. <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-29j\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-29j\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-29j</a><br/><br/>But back to non-financial institutions and the risks they pose... Sanders has never indicated that they aren't in need of their own reforms. He's been railing against the damage that money in politics has caused and the generalized corporate greed that has been rotting our society to its core.<br/><br/>While Prof. Krugman is not saying, now, that 2010 reforms weren't  enough, former Congressman Barney Frank made an argument that is false about bank and risks in a hot debate against Robert Reich and made no sense. It's about consolidation and risk, as well as lack of regulation. <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2ao\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2ao\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2ao</a><br/><br/>We need reforms in just about every sector of government to undo 30 years of rot.",
