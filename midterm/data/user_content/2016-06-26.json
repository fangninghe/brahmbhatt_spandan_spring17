				"commentBody": "We have a bumper crop of home-grown tomatoes this year, and we&#x27;re approaching &quot;tomato fatigue.&quot; Saw this ultra-simple recipe, cooked it exactly per the instructions, and came up with a tasty, thin tomato soup. I had to add about 1/2 cup of Cento tomato paste to get it to the nappe consistency.  Turns out the usual homegrown varieties are too watery.  You need the really meaty Romas or San Marzanos to pull this off as a real sauce.   We also missed a hint of garlic.  Next time!",

I'm convinced that the party hast lost so much ground in congress because it played defense against the one-line or two-word prescriptions of GOP/TP extremists; its candidates lost many seats because they were too inept to crisply describe what the Dems have done and would do for people.  <br/><br/>Many of us warned here that the Dems need to spread Bernie's conviction message if they are to win.  That still applies with Hillary as the messenger.  The fate of Britain's \"remain\" campaign provides a further warning.  If it is not heeded we will wake up on November 9 with Trump as the President-elect.",

Since the young man Mr. Kristof is using as his prime example of a refugee, wouldn't it make sense for him to remain in Mexico? He would be much safer than he would have been in his country of Honduras, and the language and culture are similar. Once an individual reaches a country that offers some relative safety, does he not then become something other than a refugee? Moving through Mexico and into the U.S., this individual becomes less and less a refugee, and more and more an individual seeking the better economic future that the U.S. offers. Mr. Kristof should be a bit more honest with the terms he throws around. No, we shouldn't be colluding with Mexico to help them with their problem. Let Mexico keep or return these 'refugees\" on their own. Let's spend all our time, money and energy in protecting our own borders. ",

I am struck by the defense of a president who tolerates a continuing flow of narcotics into this country through the very countries generating the flow of young refugees he then returns to their death. And I am struck by the defense of a president who can look at his daughters living in comfort and security and apparently ignore the reality that their comfort and security a generation from now is bound to Carlos and Cristobal. To Carlos and Cristobal I would suggest they go home and join those gangs emerging from the narcotics trade. Send narcotics to the US to plague the lives of Harvard students and their families. Make common cause with the half-million American citizens deported to Mexico because their families were forced to leave. They have US citizenship, the right to return, and many have a deep anger at the country that rejected them. There are plenty of ways to pay us back and we should anticipate all of them. We have great explanations as to why we turn our backs on these kids but do not expect them to be reasonable and understanding.  Go south? South you find Nicaragua, a country ravaged by American aggression when the people rose against a US-supported regime.
