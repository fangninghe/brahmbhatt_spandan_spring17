				"commentBody": "By 2020, a President Trump would have gutted the Establishments of both parties, the Republicans who lost control to him, and the DNC who lost to even him. He would give us two new parties.<br/><br/>By 2020, a President Hillary would have cemented into place the Establishments of both parties. Her patronage would have brought in a whole swath of the worst in DEC, featuring the neocons, Wall Street, and all of her awful friends.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Paul Ryan  and his ilk would have returned to the \"normal\" of the last eight years, cemented in as the party saying \"no\" to Hillary and investigating her in a never ending series of scandals, many imagined, but many real, and all of them given ammo by her mishandling.<br/><br/>The long term you cite would clearly be better under a President Trump, however painful it might be getting there. Then again, Hillary will be very painful indeed in wars, scandals, trade agreements, banking, everything she can sell.",

				"commentBody": "When my son was in high school, he volunteered one summer in an organization in Bogot\u00e1 that was developing a curriculum for peace education in schools located in poor and conflict-affected regions of the country. It was not glamorous work and he did it at a time when few thought that a negotiated settlement to the armed conflict was possible.   <br/><br/>The experience likely had little impact on his acceptance to college. However, it did instill in him a fierce interest in human rights and made him a passionate advocate for a negotiated peace to our country's protracted armed conflict. What he learned that summer became part of a larger engagement with the world, intellectually, emotionally, physically and altruistically. It helped him feel a part of something much larger than himself. <br/><br/>This type of engagement and potential for personal growth is what is clearly lacking in the experiences described by Mr. Bruni.  <br/><br/>The Jesuits teach that it is noble and gratifying to serve others. It is not noble to take advantage of other's needs or suffering for personal gain. The anecdotes of rich parents buying AIDs clinics in Africa to advance their children's applications to elite universities is frankly repulsive. Victims of disease, armed conflict and poverty are not props to be used by affluent parents.<br/><br/>Thank you Mr. Bruni for exposing such venality and superficiality and for advocating for change in the admission processes at some of the world's leading universities.",

				"commentBody": "As the proud father of two Eagle Scouts, I can tell you that service is not a one time thing. It is a practiced lifestyle that eventually becomes part of a person's character. Travel is important as well. The broadest possible view of the world: the good and bad, the happy and sad, the beautiful and ugly need to be seen, heard and experienced first hand. <br/><br/>With that said, I don't think any respectable college or university would be fooled by a one-time trip or one-time service project. Universities look for patterns of service and leadership. They look for inventiveness and a point of view. If you want your child to succeed, I offer you this advice: let them serve from an early age. Include them in complex \"adult discussions\" and allow them to form a point of view. To the degree possible, let them travel. Keep in mind these things don't have to cost a lot; traveling from Brooklyn to Manhattan can be an inexpensive eye opener and you'd be surprised how many kids have never done it!<br/><br/>Even if they don't get into Harvard, the lessons they'll learn will serve them well for the rest of their lives. Final piece of advice: Scouting is a great way serve, travel, learn skills, make life-long friends and form the foundation for the very pattern universities and employers are looking for.",

				"commentBody": "The NRA supports Trump.  Trump will take support wherever and however he can get it.  The fact is that most gun owners are responsible.  The problem is that it's still too easy to get a gun in America.  People, especially black people, are being killed by whites who feel threatened by blacks being around them.  These people are getting away with murder.  A black male buying snacks is not always a criminal.  Black males having a party are not necessarily threats to the neighborhood.  But there is a section of society that views them that way.  <br/><br/>Then there are the people who believe that they must own semi automatic weapons designed to kill soldiers in wars.  I can understand owning a rifle to hunt.  I do not understand why any civilian needs to own a semi automatic weapon or any gun designed to shred flesh.  And Trump's wink wink, nod nod to those who are \"worried\" about their right to own guns being taken away should be called what it is:  an invitation to kill.  In other words, Trump is more interested in winning than he is in looking at the rights and responsibilities of gun owners.  God help us when it comes to nuclear weapons and Trump.  ",

P.C. contributed to the success of Donald Trump and he exploited the resentment. He is the catalyst unleashing the suppressed bigotry and hatred in America. Trump's GOP primary victory and the surrender of the GOP leadership in Congress give the OK for the haters to act out. It is just like what happened in UK after the Brexit vote. The British bigots openly terrorizing immigrant neighborhoods following the marginal Brexit success at the poll. That gave them cover. So Donald Trump should not shoulder all the blame. The venom had been brewing among his supporters for some time, they are waiting to bite. It can be traced back to how the Tea Party reacted to the election of a (half) black president. Birthers are pure and simple overt racists. Once out of the Pandora's box, it will be difficult to bring the hatred back under control. The outlook is not pretty.",

While some service trips abroad do a better job of teaching structural factors than others, the way that the sector and the incentives from college admissions process emphasize \"what you can do\" takes away focus from structural factors in approaches to international inequality and poverty. <br/><br/>I don't think it's entirely fair to blame the sector or admissions or even the volunteers for this approach -- it's a baked-in narrative in the US that people in the developing world are poor and held back but also resilient, that these are usually people of color, and (more recently) that they are strong in poverty and experience happiness (just like us!) but implicitly do not have agency (financial or, obliquely, otherwise) to solve their own problems. It's a giant American cliche. <br/><br/>Of course these students want to go out and fix these problems! The whole narrative of poverty makes it look easy, like all it takes is some compassion and a passionate kid who cares. The volunteers I worked with were bright, motivated kids who wanted to make a difference. The narrative did not prepare them for reality.",

They promised that they could legislate the culture, outlaw abortion, discriminate against gays, etc. But the culture will be what the people want it to be. Failure #2 has been that we can all live the great life and not have to pay for it. We can be the world's policeman, live in a clean environment free of cancer causing substances, no need for regulations on businesses, have unlimited growth in Social Security/Medicare, all without having to pay much in taxes. But of course this was all a lie. Republicans were selling the snake oil that people wanted. But people finally woke up the fact it was all a con, so they turned to Trump. <br/><br/>In Trump the people have given up on our democracy that couldn't deliver what they wanted, but instead now back a tyrant. A modern day mafia don wannabe. Give him the power and he will bend all the laws to make it happen for his supporters, This is a very desperate move. Extremely risky to turn the country over to an unhinged megalomaniac. <br/><br/>And by the way, it's not a lack of religion that has turned the country to be immoral, but a lack of values. Anyone can dress up and go to church on Sunday. No need for any real belief in concepts like self sacrifice, ethics, sharing, working together, compromise, etc. Spirituality doesn't require belonging to an organized religion.    ",

They needed to learn that we parents expected each to act in the other's house in the same manner as we expected them to act in their own house.  To a five-year old, this was a revelation, that rules mattered as much when one was abroad as when one was at home.  After a couple of backyard over-the-fence chats between us mothers, we explained our expectations to the children, and pretty soon they caught on.<br/><br/>Communities need to explain to their members that consideration for the other needs to extend beyond the community, and that kindness and thoughtfulness matter and are the glue that holds us together, the thing that makes better things possible. Holding to this standard is possible, even amid the current noise, and groups like Smoke Rise Baptist set the example.  All that is required, is will.",

They failed in both counts.  The republicans cannot get over the fact that the nation elected a black president, and actually, was able to get the nation out of the whole where Bush let us.  trump is nothin else than the clear x-ray photo of a white racist loosing minority, unable and unwilling to deal with the changing demographics of the country.  Too bdd, we are here to stay, and to keep America the great country that already is.",

Hillary Clinton and some middle to upper socio-economic class people hold working class people in low esteem.  The working class is easily denigrated and ignored.<br/><br/>Hillary Clinton and her ilk do not realize the extent of the economic damage Free Trade and illegal immigration have been having on the working class and the poor.  Free Trade and illegal immigration have made it harder for them to find steady, decent paying work.  Working women do not marry the father(s) of their children because the fathers earn so little money that they are seen as just \u201canother mouth to feed\u201d.  Today 40% of babies are being born to parents who are not married.  Even if the unmarried parents are living together when their baby is born, they usually split up by the time the child enters kindergarten.  We have more and more children growing up without their fathers.  Yet, Hillary Clinton and her supporters seem unaware of what ordinary Americans are going through.<br/><br/>Free Trade pacts let companies move many well-paying working class jobs out of the country.  And illegal immigrants have both taken many of the remaining jobs and kept wages low.  Yet, if an unemployed person complains about illegal immigrants, he is labeled a racist and ignored.  <br/><br/>Why do we care more about economic migrants than for our own people?",

These pacts let manufacturers move their plants to countries with cheap labor and unenforced environmental laws, and then sell their products here without having to pay tariffs.  The result is substantially fewer jobs for America\u2019s working class (regardless of race).<br/><br/>Only 17% of the undocumented work on farms.   <br/><br/>When the Free Trade pacts enabled manufacturing to move abroad, many working class men found jobs in construction.  Many of them have now been displaced by illegal immigrants.  All of the new houses in my neighborhood are being built by crews of Hispanic men who speak little or no English.  You would not be able to get a job working with them unless you spoke Spanish.  And I\u2019ve read that these jobs are advertised only on special Spanish language apps.<br/><br/>Before illegal immigrants began arriving in droves, jobs such as yard work, babysitting, house and hotel cleaning, and restaurant work used to be done by high school students, newly-graduated young adults, and less educated adults of all ages.  Now Americans are having trouble finding these kinds of entry-level jobs because they\u2019ve been given to illegal immigrants.<br/><br/>Clinton has supported NAFTA, CAFTA, and (until recently) the TPP, as well as illegal immigration.  Our current Free Trade pacts and illegal immigration have made life harder for working class Americans.",

Bush to make the worst foreign policy blunder in U.S. history\"<br/><br/>Maureen is talking about Hillary, but she might as well be talking about her own newspaper. Hillary got it wrong, but so did the New York Times editorial board. <br/><br/>What about Ms Dowd herself? Of the four columns she wrote before the vote on October 11th, 2002, only two mentioned the war vote, and one of those was mostly about Hillary. Dowd said of Hillary that, \"Whatever doubts she may have privately about the war, she is not articulating her angst as loudly as some of her Democratic colleagues. She knows that any woman who hopes to be elected president cannot have love beads in her jewelry case.\"<br/><br/>In her column 'Culture war with B-2's', Dowd comes out as mildly anti-war. \"Don't feel bad if you have the uneasy feeling that you're being steamrolled\", Dowd writes, \"You are not alone.\" Fourteen years later that column still looks good, and I link to it at the bottom. However, Dowd could and should have done a lot more. I don't think that anybody who draws a paycheck from the New York Times has a right to get on their high horse and lecture Hillary about her vote. They ignored the antiwar protests just like they ignored Bernie Sanders' large crowds. <br/><br/>The Bush Administration hinted that the anti-war people were traitors and terrorist sympathizers and everybody got steamrolled. <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/opinion/culture-war-with-b-2-s.html\" title=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/opinion/culture-war-with-b-2-s.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/22/opinion/culture-war-with-b-2-s.html</a> ",
