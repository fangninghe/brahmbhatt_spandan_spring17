				"commentBody": "AP has just disenfranchised voters going to the polls on Tuesday. As if to say , itis over, your vote has no bearing on the convention.You are just participating in an excersize. All of this over Super Delegates that were polled. A Super Delegate is \"an unelected delegate who is free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination at the party's national convention\". The AP story also makes a point that New Jersey would be the tipping point. So I guess Californians can stay home. Mrs. Clinton is a better choice than Mr, Trump but I will write in a candidate. I live in New York, it had historically voted for the Democratic candidate so we all win. I can vote with a clear conscience for another Democrat via write in and she will win New York. ",

				"commentBody": "\tMs. Clinton is both a formidable statesman and a competent administrator. She has dedicated much of her life to public service going back to her years as First Lady of Arkansas. She has been an advocate for women's rights, child welfare, quality public education and health care reform. And as former Secretary of State she has considerable experience with foreign affairs.<br/>\tHer Republican opponent is an egomaniacal braggart who has spent his life in the service of his bank account, a xenophobic, misogynist, anti-intellectual, racist bigot, petty and vindictive whose only qualification for office is his mouth. Clinton's election ought to be pro forma.<br/>\tAnd yet it could all be swept away because of a jaw dropping, bad decision by Ms Clinton regarding her e-mails. While I intend to vote for her this November, I am so angry at Ms. Clinton for putting the entire country at risk, indeed the whole world, just so she could control the scrutiny of her messages.<br/>\tI like everything Ms Clinton stands for but I hate having to constantly defend her poor judgment. Quite honestly, I wish I had a better representative of the Progressive Cause. ",

Obama laid such a fine foundation for a decent and reasonable government, he will be greatly missed. But, in the end, he is still a man.<br/><br/>Since my mother first wiped my mouth as a very young child, I realized there was something different about her, something that set her entirely apart from my father. Something that makes all women different, and very special in their own right. So if God smiles upon this nation yet again (even though millions support a petulant and dangerous Donald), She will bless us with the realization that a woman can do a man's job. (And that those labels need to go. Now.)<br/><br/>Congratulations to Hillary Clinton! May she be the best President I will see in my lifetime. She will have to be since woman are judged far harsher than men. <br/><br/>I am very proud of the Democrats who voted for her. We have endured many slanders from Bernie and his bunch. They have driven up Clinton's negatives with every lousy lie under the sun. But we knew all along how strong Clinton is. And we knew where the real revolution would start. (It surely wasn't by putting another guy in the Oval Office!)<br/><br/>Please don't groan, but I have to say it, especially considering her long climb from those early middle class days in Park Ridge.<br/><br/>Ms. Clinton, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY, BABY!",
