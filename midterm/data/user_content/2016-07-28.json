He doesn't get angry at the massive rise in the shooting deaths in Chicago, where I think there have already been 2000 murders this year, mostly blacks by other blacks.  He doesn't get angry at the percentage of black babies born out of wedlock - 70% (if you can believe that).  He doesn't get mad when Michael Ferguson assaults a shop owner while stealing; and he doesn't get angry that the lie which started the Ferguson riots (arms up, don't shoot) results in the looting of many Asian-owned businesses.  He also doesn't get angry when the Baltimore prosecutor trumps up murder charges against the police officers involved in the Gray death, three of whom were black.  (Black police officers' lives don't matter to Mr. Blow apparently.)  No, Mr. Blow mainly gets angry when a Republican uses the phrase \"law and order\" which has also now apparently become a dog whistle for white supremacists according to Mr. Blow. ",

				"commentBody": "Mr. Blow, I am so sad to read the feelings you have expressed. The justice system is not equipped to address the problems cited by you and the eminent Mr. Baldwin, for all kinds of reasons. When the medical examiner says a death is a \"homicide\", this means that it was the result of human agency, i.e., not necessarily criminality. In the rush to charge these suspects, the state apparently did not do adequate analysis of the evidence or applicable statutes. If there is acquittal after acquittal, whether by jury or bench (another factor to take into account in charging  is what kind of trial defense might likely demand and why), there is a problem with the state's proof. This exacerbates the problem of responding properly to the conduct alleged here. Whatever the justice system does wrong--and it does plenty--it will surely make worse mistakes if it acts in the heat of the twenty-four-hour news cycle.",

				"commentBody": "I point out that a black judge presided over the trials and acquittals of three officers charged over the Freddie Gray incident and found them innocent on all counts.  The case against the police officers was very weak from the start, so weak that they probably shouldn't even have been charged.  The charges against the remaining officers were equally weak and the prosecutor realized the futility of pressing on and dropped them.  Rage all you want -  I think the acquittals were just and there was no sense in proceeding to trial against the remaining officers.<br/><br/>The fact is most police shootings are justified, regardless of race, and that's why few officers are charged and even fewer convicted.

But the problem is that our militarised police quickly escalate encounters with the public, especially black Americans, use force all too often, and kill far too many people each DAY.  Of those killed, most are justified shootings, but the absolute number of unjustified shootings in the US is staggering.  Without accountability and arrests of officers who abuse their positions of power or are negligent in their actions, this sad situation will continue, or even worsen.  At least, either the driver or the officer who failed to put the prisoner in restraints in the vehicle were negligent, but now they get off scott free. ",
