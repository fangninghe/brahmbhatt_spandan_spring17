				"commentBody": "I think some of your comments are rather harsh. Areas of our country deal with unemployment rates that are too high as well....but we are also a country with a social safety net that offers support at those times. We too have immigrants willing to do jobs for lower wages and 2nd or 3rd generation Canadians who may feel entitled to better paying jobs. And we have yet to solve those disparities. But we need immigration because our population growth is not enough to support our future. Knowing many Canadians who have gone to live and work in your country, I haven't heard them be self- righteous but actually appreciative of the opportunities. And your country can be quite selective about who they take in.",

				"commentBody": "Eleanor - When I was volunteering at the settlement society, one of the questions I was asked was about the small size of Canadian families.  My answer was the children are expensive and so Canadians don't have so many because they want to provide well for each one.  There was a moment of thoughtful silence.  That had not really been an issue for the people I was talking to, and a new one for them to consider here, where they could hope that their kids would have better education opportunities.  Families get smaller as education levels and income go up.<br/><br/>Planned Parenthood exists in Canada but is not the default reproductive care provider for poor people.  Canadians all have access to a family doctor that has no user fees or co-pays. That *socialist* medicine you know.",

One result of Mr. Obama's attitude about lying is that the share of Americans feeling proud of their country has dropped from 70% to 50% under this arrogant huckster. <br/><br/>    King Charles II and Marie Antoinette also saw their government lose its credibility with the French.<br/>     His being an ineffectual loser in international affairs is just icing on the cake.<br/>BUT his approach shots are looking much better, if that helps.

I appreciate having a conversation related to 'advanced' technology versus actual advances. Tesla over sells. Don't blame the company, but they could really use a little humility and exercise some honesty in their operations. Never should label as 'Autonomous'. Should be 'assist' if they want to be true to the current technology.",

Probably fifteen years to turn over half the fleet.  And that's not even answering the question of where all this extra electricity is coming from, when we're struggling now to get 15% of the electricity that we currently \"need\" from renewables.  <br/><br/>Looking at the big picture, even more problems with the environment associated with the individual vehicle, whether electric or now, self-navigating or not, including: sprawl and loss of crop land and biodiversity; storm water runoff as well as large energy inputs associated with roads and parking lots; large houses with mountains of junk contained within; trillions of dollars spent on health care that are unavailable to spend on other things, etc.<br/><br/>Just another example of wanting something for nothing.  Still stuck in a \"paper or plastic?\" mindset.  We know how to arrange our built environment to minimize negative impacts on the natural environment:  compact, walkable towns and cities.  Which happen to go hand in hand with public transportation systems, and they don't even require passengers to drive.  ",
