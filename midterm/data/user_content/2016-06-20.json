PK thinks Sanders doesn't know from nuttin' about how to reach - or even takee the next several steps toward - the goals they share. PK also asserts that the specifics Sanders proposed undermine the process. He's very specific about why he thinks Sanders doesn't know what he's doing.<br/><br/>It has *nothing* to do with goals.",

Curry is a great shooter but also one dimensional. James brings everything to the table: points, assists, blocks, and rebounds. Kyrie Irving is a threat from everywhere on the floor, a genius of improvisation to Curry's robotics. Great teams win in the paint - and in the paint it wasn't even close. ",

				"commentBody": "Sisters are certainly doing it for themselves on GoT - and Jon Snow still knows nothing. Ramsay's psychological digs - calling Jon names, and killing Rickon to egg Snow into the very trap on the battlefield that Sansa predicted  - lasted to the very end. His taunts to Sansa, even as he sat bloodied in the very place that he killed his stepmother and newborn stepbrother via dogs - ugh. But this episode also featured the loss of yet another beloved follower - we recently suffered the loss of Hodor, protecting Bran. This week, Dundun was done, helping Jon. We will miss Dundun. The battle scenes were horrific and hard to watch, but beautifully directed and filmed - now we know why the last 3 episodes were dull, and a lot of deaths were offscreen - the Waif and Blackfish - to save the budget for this week's epic battle. Truly frightening, it reminded me of the opening 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan - you did not want to watch, but could not turn away. Well done, GoT cast and crew. ",

I think the FM would be the worst we have for a little bit, i don't know much about Euron. While it is good to have a person we hate... an evil man, we know Petyr has a very shady side and has someone said chooses to be evil.

				"commentBody": "This was a great episode, definitely the best since Hardhome. Orchestrating two major battle scenes in the span of an hour takes quite a bit of directorial skill.  The aerial scenes from the dragons-eye view in Meereen were stunning.  The battle for Winterfell reminded me quite a bit of Lord of the Rings, but in a good way.  The claustrophobic scene of Jon being trampled and buried was particularly well done.  Littlefinger's arrival with his army wasn't exactly a surprise, but it was welcome, so no complaints from me.<br/><br/>It was good to see Sansa finally take her revenge on Ramsay.  I think most people had correctly guessed how Ramsay would meet his demise, but it was satisfying nonetheless.  RIP Wun Win. Not a good season for the big guys.<br/><br/>For me, this episode completed the transition of the women from abused and powerless characters early on to strong and dominant players now. Between Dany, Yara, Sansa, the Martell women in Dorne, and Margaery Tyrell (who I suspect is plotting behind the scenes in King's Landing), the women are now truly running the show.  The fact that this change feels believable is a credit to the storytelling in this series.",

His plan for a pincer failed and it was Ramsay who used a pincer. However, let's not rush to laud Sansa just yet. If she had told Jon about the Arryn army beforehand, the Stark army could have waited another day and a lot of wildling/Mormonts/other northern lives would have been spared. Here's hoping that both Starks have learned the lesson of listening and trusting the other. They'll need a united front against the master manipulator, Littlefinger (though I'm hoping Bran shows up early in season 7 to poke big holes in Littlefinger's stories, especially the ones Sansa doesn't know).<br/>As gratifying as Ramsay's death was, the comeuppance of the 3 masters was also quite good from Dany's line about the day her reign began to Grey worm's quick execution. I think the days of men underestimating her are officially OVER.",
