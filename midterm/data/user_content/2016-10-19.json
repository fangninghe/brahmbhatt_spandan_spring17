				"commentBody": "No one disputes that it is important to be vigilant about irregularities, but for the GOP candidate to say, absent any evidence, that the election is \"rigged\" would be irresponsible to start with.  When you step back and consider that Trump's whole campaign is rooted in bigotry, anger, aggression, and tacit approval of violence, it becomes downright dangerous.  I'm no liberal, but you'd have to be a fool to think that Trump is merely calling for responsible monitoring of the polls.  This man's credibility is zero.  He has tried every sleazy measure he can think of to save him from what is shaping up to be a very embarrassing loss on November 8th.  I know people's partisan feelings shade their perception of things, and I am no fan of Hillary myself, but there is a point at which you need to set the politicking aside and recognize someone for what he is.  Donald Trump is an egomaniacal monster who would burn this country to the ground if it will spare him the humiliation coming toward him in three weeks.  Enough with the GOP posturing.  We all need to just come together and admit this whole election has been a black mark and move on.  I for one hope the GOP refocuses and brings back a candidate the caliber of Romney or McCain next time.  But this cause is lost.  The only thing left to do is be responsible and patriotic, and denounce this cretin and his unfounded cries of fraud along with him, or I fear there is a very good chance something very bad will happen on Election Day.",

				"commentBody": "It is troubling that this article focuses so heavily on Cliff Mass. He is known for pushing against the increasing evidence of the influence of global warming/climate change in weather trends.<br/><br/>He is a top meteorologist making valuable points, as presented here. But his bias against accepting the connection, while not exactly climate science denial, overstates the lack of connection.<br/><br/>To repeat: overstates the lack of connection. The problem is, there appears to be a mental block to increasing evidence in weather over time. It's hard enough for your average Joe or Jane to figure out what is real and what is not without the delicate thumb on the scale.<br/><br/>I wish the author had consulted with some other scientists. His justifiable affection and respect for the dynamic Cliff Mass needs some context.<br/><br/>It's not quite the same thing, but people blaming Obama for the defunding of science and equipment at NOAA are making a similar mistake. Except for 5 months in 2009, all budgetary efforts have been subjected to an increasingly unified opposition, one that allows no deviation from the religion of climate science denial, which is not skeptical at all.<br/><br/>Our weather people are well aware of the European model. The new GOES satellite should help, but Matthew in Florida likely did some harm to Cape Canaveral which may result in launch delay.<br/><br/>Here's an excellent statistical review of one of his efforts:<br/><a href=\"https://tamino.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/cliff-mass-picking-cherries-in-full-denier-mode/\" title=\"https://tamino.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/cliff-mass-picking-cherries-in-full-denier-mode/\" target=\"_blank\">https://tamino.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/cliff-mass-picking-cherries-in-f...</a>",

I think it's a better way to vote and wish the entire country would switch over to vote-by-mail. Plus, there's a paper trail. And no code that can be hacked, at least not at the individual, polling-station level - I suppose county databases could be hacked, but you'd still have the mailed-in paper ballots as backup once a hack was detected.",
