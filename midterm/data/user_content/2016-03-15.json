Our current political extremism is based upon the unwillingness of compromise, otherwise known as selfishness. Soccer, itself, cannot be violent, because soccer is essentially unselfish. Now, there are acts of violence within soccer that get penalized. A yellow card is a reaction to selfishness. Selfishness is outside the rules of soccer, therefore it must be penalized. Trump, the extreme narcissist, is selfish. He is too selfish to hold his tongue. Terrorism is essentially selfishness; the unwillingness to compromise political position. Ultimately, all very immature.",

				"commentBody": "I'm interested to see how John Kasich, who seems kind of scary to me - but scary in that real nice, down-home way! - does in Ohio. Like Senator Rubio, if his own state doesn't carry him in voting, then Gov. Kasich is pretty much gone, though he seems stubborn enough to stick it out for a while, sensing that a group of Republicans may see him as Obi-Wan, their only hope against Mr. Trump (and Sen. Cruz). <br/><br/>I believe I read on NYT First Draft recently that Gov. Kasich told a crowd something like where he's from, people don't go for VP - they go for the top. I think he might have to rethink that, and maybe go back to Ohio and take care of his own house. I read that after Gov. Kasich defunded Planned Parenthood a few weeks ago, the PP center in Columbus was vandalized a week ago and defaced with the words \"Satan Den of Babykillers God See Allll (sic) Mark 9:14\". <br/><br/>Thanks, Kasich!<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/03/07/Planned-Parenthood-vandalism.html\" title=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/03/07/Planned-Parenthood-vandalism.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/03/07/Planned-Parenth...</a>",
