Moneyed interests can create a myth that, based on polls or other non-verifiable information, Candidate X is bound to win unless people vote for Candidate Z, who has no chance of winning but can deny the race for X.  The media amplify the myth.  Now we have voters who are voting under this influence and denying Candidate Y from winning.  In other words, strategic voting is based on some pre-determined view of the outcome, which is subject to manipulation.  A dangerous idea in a real democracy.",

Trump's are extraordinary and unprecedented.  If he is the nominee, it seems very unlikely he could defeat Clinton (despite her own unfortunate negatives), and he might even be unable to beat Sanders.  Although one frequently sees the claim that Clinton supporters are unenthusiastic, polls, particularly of African-American voters, show high levels of enthusiasm.   And Trump has alienated women to a spectacular degree.  Krugman may well be within his rights to presume a Clinton victory.",

It's clear the organizations in question, which are not actual churches, want more then the ability not to have to pay for birth control pills. No, what they want instead is the ability to impose their religious beliefs and rules on their employees of whatever age or religious bent. And that violates the First Amendment.<br/><br/>I thought it interesting we're talking about anti-contraceptives, when these pills do more then prevent pregnancy. They are used also for regulating the hormonal cycle to control the growth of uterine fibroids, a condition from which I was suffered. Would the little sisters of the poor require employees to specifically state the nature of the reason for needing these products? I wonder why that argument didn't come before the court!<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me here was the admittance by the religious organizations that they are \"equal opportunity employers. \" That belies the nature of this case, since if religion is not a litmus test for hiring as they state, then why is it their business to impose on employees their Catholic beliefs? <br/><br/>Their employees are not nuns themselves, even if the sisters are acting as if they were.",

				"commentBody": "Glancing over the comments here I can see a lot of the usual ventilation about \"greedy capitalists\" and so forth, but the truth is that people acting individually can affect climate by making choices to not eat meat, not drive a car when they could ride a bike, and so forth.  The most significant difference people can make is electing to not have children.   <br/><br/>That said, increasing air and water temperatures will lead to more precipitation over Antarctica, which will continue to be a sub-freezing place (for the most part), and so glaciers will continue tp accrue there even if there is some instability on the margins.   If anyone claims definite predictions about sea level 100 years from now based on computer models I wouldn't get all that excited about it quite yet.    But for those who are concerned, as pointed out above, your life style choices do make a difference.   ",

				"commentBody": "James Powell and Gordon Danby are great scientists.  I was fortunate to hear them when they testified before the US Senate Environment &amp; Public Works Committee, Chaired by Senator Moynihan of NY who rediscovered them &amp; Maglev in 1987 and he requested that they appear and testify.  They did &amp; were asked to lead a study committee of Maglev &amp; transportation experts,  The report made a convincing case that a Maglev transport network capable of carrying both trucks &amp; passengers at an average speed of 300 mph and also capable of electronic switching and operating on conventional railroads on Maglev adapted railroad tracks should be our next surface transport system to add capacity to our aging, costly and congested Interstate Highway System.  This became a bi-partisan RDTE proposal to the Senate and it passed but it failed to get out of Committee in the House because of strong opposition of existing transport interests.  Clearly, a huge mistake because this all-electric, all-weather, low-maintenance, no-emissions, lower cost system is perfect for the challenge that we now face.  In 2000, Powell &amp; Danby were awarded the Franklin Medal for Engineering. <br/><br/>BNL's 50th anniversary celebration of the 1966 SC Maglev invention. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/_pikyp8Y-vQ?t=6m49s\" title=\"https://youtu.be/_pikyp8Y-vQ?t=6m49s\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/_pikyp8Y-vQ?t=6m49s</a> <br/><br/>They have written about this remarkable technology in \"The Fight for Maglev \", \"Maglev America\", \"Startram: The Next Race to Space\", &amp; soon will publish \"Silent Earth\", bringing a technology solution to Global Warming challenge.",
