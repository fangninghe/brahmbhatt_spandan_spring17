Unlike Powell who simply used a private e-mail account, not a server, she went to a lot of trouble. That is a stretch of the truth in itself. Yet, she could have eliminated all of her problem is she had turned the server over to an independent entity to sort through the e-mails and yet, she did not. Her own lawyers did the sorting and so called \"personal e-mails\" were not simply moved to a personal computer - which could have been easily done. They were destroyed with specialized software designed to \"shred\" them. Maybe you can move past this blatant display of evasion, but I cannot. I cannot vote for someone who is so calavlier in her regard for honesty and truth.",

				"commentBody": "What if Hillary had done what the Trump campaign did with John Kasich?  Kasich was offered the vice presidency and \"being in charge of foreign and domestic policy\" while Trump as president would be national cheerleader \"making America great again\"!!!  <br/><br/>Unlike Trump, Hillary not only wants to be president, she wants to actually do the job and has the experience to prove it.  Trump wants to 'be president' the same way a pretty girl wants to win a beauty pageant - to be wearing the sash \"Miss -----\"  Trump wants to be able to parade around wearing a sash that says \"President\" but he obviously doesn't want to do the work.  Trump's never done an honest day's work in his life when he could con someone out of their money.  Work is for suckers.<br/><br/>As Trump is a man who reportedly won't learn anything, has zero attention span, never reads anything and does as little work as possible, I honestly can't figure out how Trump graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.  Maybe the NYT wants to look into that?<br/><br/>Enough with the NYT's false equivalency of pounding Hillary while not even scratching the surface of Trump's frauds, cons, lies, bankruptcies, civil rights crimes, use of slave labor in Dubai.<br/><br/>Cover it and report it, NYT.",

You said, \"There is no way Hillary or any elected official should be given the opportunity to use a private email server.\"  I agree.<br/><br/>During the famous 11-hour interview of Hillary by the Benghazi Committee last spring, Rep. Ted  Lieu of California's 33rd Cong. district pointed out that EVERY member of Congress is AUTOMATICALLY granted a security clearance without vetting and many of them, if not all, use their own private email servers.<br/><br/>So, I suggest that the Trump campaign and the Republicans and the media now ask the FBI for ALL the emails of all our elected Congress members to see what dire secrets they've given away and what crimes they've committed.  <br/><br/>Thirty years is way past time for all these Republican-and-media-created  \"ClintonGate\" witch-hunts to end.

She admitted sending emails containing State Department business to staff on their personal email accounts, claiming to have only done so when their .gov accounts were down;<br/>4. She denied any knowledge of how her lawyers decided which emails were personal and which related to State Department work;<br/>5. She did not review any emails her lawyers deleted to determine for herself if they were personal or related to State Department &amp; did not provide input for process to decide what was work related;<br/>6. She did not recall receiving training on document classification (allows her to avoid a finding of intentionally violating such training);<br/>7.

I actually think the FBI/Comey are winning the contest, with their exquisitely timed releases, exactly when Trump needs the help the most.  <br/><br/>The NYTimes for its part, finds it an easy sell to feature the ready-made 'news' trickling out.  It's right there!  You don't have to do anything but print it!  EMAILS!!  MORE EMAILS!!  OMG!!  ELECTRONIC DEVICES SHE'S GOT NOW!!<br/><br/>Gentlemen and gentlewomen of the NYTimes, have you forgotten Putin's hack not only of the DNC and the NSA hacking team, but also state electoral databases?  Putin, acting on his own and through Wikileaks, has penetrated well into the US Presidential election for 2016.  These hacks are affirmed by US high intelligence and other professionals.  Comey's response was a pro-forma letter to the states--be on guard.  Now back to the important stuff--the emails.  Have you forgotten Trump's many ties, and his advisors' ties to Putin and RT news?  Can you not connect the dots?  Trump is Putin's guy.  <br/><br/>Is there not a story here?  Would Trump as President sell out NATO as he has promised he would, in exchange for a favorable siting decision (and financing) from Putin.  NY Times and others are highly obsessed about the Clinton foundation if Hillary is President:  Has you ever wondered about what Trump would do to help Trump INC?",
