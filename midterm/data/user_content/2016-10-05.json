There was the de rigeur abortion question and a bit about policing which triggered fulsome rhetoric from Pence and little more, but no inquiries into LGBTQ rights (or Pence's history of supporting legislation that allows discrimination, or his preference for taking money from AIDS medication and putting it toward \"conversion\" therapy), gun safety and control, education equity and funding (given Trump's plan to abolish the Department of Education and thus a crucial source of funding for disabled students, ESL learners, and the poor), environment and energy issues, climate change and science in general, on and on.  I was hugely disappointed.",

He made many Indiana residents miss the previous governor, who was part of the Bush administration. <br/><br/>So please don't be fooled by the understated demeanor.

No, Pence lied repeatedly to Americans by denying that Donald Trump and he made numerous statements that Kaine asked him about.  Such commentators do a disservice to Americans when they overlook baldfaced lies and declare a lying candidate the winner.  <br/><br/>Earlier in the day some of these same commentators were having fun showing us person-in-the-street interviews in which few people even knew who Kaine and Pence were.  So, they might have realized these Americans would not know whether the candidates' statements were true or false.<br/><br/>But the commentators have become so desensitized by the volume of lies from the Trump campaign that they discount them and tonight gave a pass to Pence who was probably believed by many viewers tonight when he denied that he or Donald Trump made statements that are all on tape.<br/><br/>A faulty judgement of our commentators went well beyond grading on the curve in favor of Trump.  Repeated lying in a debate should disqualify a candidate, not make him the winner because he remained cool when lying, looked like a statesman, didn't interrupt as much, was polite!  Good Heavens journalists, you are supposed to be professionals.  You are supposed to use your knowledge to help Americans understand the differences between the candidates, not to get so jaded by lies and distanced from the information needs of average Americans that you mislead them.",
