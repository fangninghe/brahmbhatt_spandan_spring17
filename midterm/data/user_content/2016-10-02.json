In the early 1970s I found it necessary to transfer from my first-year law school in one city to a law school in another city - a difficult situation for the very few female law students at that time. Most transfers, I heard, were for (male) law students in the military. I went to hear a presentation by the then pioneer women's rights lawyer - Ruth Bader Ginsburg. After her inspiring presentation, I went up to thank her and mentioned my situation, asking for advice. This lovely, loving woman offered to write a letter for me to the law school I wanted to transfer to. She did, and I was admitted. Thanks to \"my hero,\" I had a 40-year legal career followed by 6 years in \"retirement\" of teaching lawyers in and from all over the world. I hope she reads this comment and my thanks to her. I have loved her for all these years from afar and have told this story in tribute to her hundreds of times in the U.S. and abroad. Thank you, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for my happy and successful life. I have carried your grace with me everywhere and paid forward what you did for me.",

It took my husband to plead to Stanford's law dean to use the principle of 'comity' to accommodate my need for a third law school year in exchange for his federal appointment. I already had 3 children and no firm would hire me in 1972 citing the fear that I would move again when my husband's employment advanced. Only one firm showed interest, but only for my supposed talents as an 'escort' for potential clients. Can you imagine? Does this still happen?",

The unanimity was unusual in a case which boiled down to the right of the country's oligarchs to buy politicians with \"gifts\".<br/><br/>Usually, the so-called \"liberal\", Democratic-appointed judges will trust that the conservative (reactionary, really) majority will win the day, so that they may maintain their liberal facade and support the minority position, but apparently the \"liberal\" judges wanted to send a message to prosecutors across the country: the wealthy are free to bribe politicians for the purpose of controlling the political process.<br/><br/>Even Justice Roberts conceded that the governor's case was a \u201ctawdry tale...of Ferraris, Rolexes and ball gowns,\u201d but the court made it clear that unless the parties involved are sufficiently clueless to leave evidence of quid pro quo, don't bother prosecuting.<br/><br/>There is often talk of \"litmus tests\" during SCOTUS confirmations, always denied, but there is surely one area which is subject to such vetting: the nominee may be conservative or liberal on social issues, but the nominee must demonstrate obsequiousness to the ruling class.",

The primacy of big money in politics must be held sacrosanct, and no one will be appointed to the SCOTUS who doesn't have a long track record congruent with that dictum.<br/><br/>Congress members do the same thing. When legislation favoring the ruling case is sure to pass, some will be free to vote on the side of the people, so that come election time, they can point to one or two populist votes and declare, \"I am a candidate of the people\".<br/><br/>That's why the only explanation for the unanimous vote to vacate the corruption conviction had to be that the justices wanted to thoroughly discourage further convictions of the wealthy for wielding their power over politicians.",
