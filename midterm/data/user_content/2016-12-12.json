His supporters and followers believe him, and believe everyone else is out to get him. <br/><br/>Whatever looks bad for Trump, his followers will dispute and act to suppress any such findings or actions. He has a following of thugs and bullies. He has encouraged them to act in threatening ways and even physical assault on is critics. It is treasonous but not as defined in the Constitution.  All we need is to be able to find him guilty of a felony, and he will be ineligible for security clearances. <br/><br/>You could end up with pence, but at least as a governor, he knows the limits despite his personal views.

It's another aspect of fake news, this isolation with people that support your prejudices.<br/><br/>Here's one good summary: <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/31/the-new-yorker-endorses-hillary-clinton\" title=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/31/the-new-yorker-endorses-hillary-clinton\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/31/the-new-yorker-endorses-hil...</a><br/><br/>A lot of people refused to take an honest look at her, and the result is as you see. <br/><br/>\"Hillary Clinton\u2019s vision and temperament are the opposite of her opponent\u2019s. She has been a pioneer throughout her life, and yet her career cannot be easily reduced to one transcendent myth: she has been an idealist and a liberal incrementalist, a glass-ceiling-smashing lawyer and a cautious establishmentarian, a wife and mother, a First Lady, a rough-and-tumble political operator, a senator, a Secretary of State. Her story is about walking through flames and emerging changed, warier and more determined. In her intelligence, in her gimlet-eyed recognition of both the limits and the possibilities of government, she\u2019s a particular kind of inspirational figure, a pragmatist and a Democratic moderate. ... her claim to our support goes far beyond the nihilism of the alternative. It is also notable that she has chosen as a running mate Tim Kaine, a highly capable politician with a record of genuine compassion; by contrast, the Republican Vice-Presidential choice, Mike Pence ....\"",

In this case our intelligence agencies have \"high confidence\", that is much more than one percent,  confidence that Republican and/or Trump e-mails, were hacked by the Russians. Until we can establish whether the content of those e-mails represent a threat to national security we must assume that they do.This is not a question of reversing the election, it is a matter of whether Donald Trump is vulnerable to Russian leverage or blackmail that could harm the interests of this country.<br/>The reported selection of Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State is a case in point. His principal recommendation seems to be he is an executive favored by Vladimir Putin. His international experience appears to center on oil deals, not a strong recommendation for much of the world given that, as in the case of Donald Trump himself, there is clear confusion between national and personal interests. But even more important is that Trump does not appear to grasp his refusal to endorse an immediate and wide-ranging review of Russian penetration  requires that on January 21st the House MUST move articles of impeachment to remove him from the presidency. We cannot risk having a president who has been compromised by Russian intelligence, or even a president with a 1 percent chance of  that. Review or impeach.  ",
