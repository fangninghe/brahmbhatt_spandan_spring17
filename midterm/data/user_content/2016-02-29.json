				"commentBody": "The author, Katalan Balog, writes, \"Much of Kierkegaard\u2019s philosophy is a warning against the tendency...to take an increasingly objective, abstract perspective on the world. While the paradigm example of this is science, it is most problematic when applied to one\u2019s own life and existence.\"<br/><br/>I am inclined to disagree as to what constitutes the most problematic implication of increased \"objectivity.\" Balog appears to juxtapose the extremes of universal truths  --  science  --  with individual perception and experience. This seems much too limited a view of the real world. \"Objectivity\" is only knowable through the subjectivity of the individual. At the same time, \"subjectivity\" is governed by universal truths, whether we are aware of them or not.<br/><br/>I would think that what is most problematic is not increased \"objectivity\" but, rather, the confusion of \"objectivity\" and \"subjectivity\" or, perhaps, the cloaking of subjectivity in the mantle of objectivity. It has become common to to take claims of hope, fear, belief, and faith and state them as facts, as objective truths. We see this not merely in the current political environment but also in everyday life in such \"controversies\" as vaccines and anthropogenic global warming. <br/><br/>In a previous age, science had to be cloaked in faith. By contrast, in our current age, faith seemingly needs to be cloaked in science.",

But at the end it is exactly like that: it's life, which in a Gestalt viewpoint means it goes beyond subject &amp; object. Life, as long as it's human, is more related to Nietzsche' wille und vorstellung through insight, so that we shouldn't forget that science &amp; 'objectivity' are just words to define a method to make world understandable in the most inner space of our mind, so we can afford to deal with nature &amp; survive as individuals first, as species then. Kierkegaard' work is pointing out to give value to our lives (all lives matter), allowing us to recognize virtue from sin, and that's always done through language, language creates reality ('objective' outer world), as it all started one million years B.P. in the way of myth, to help us to understand for surviving, it is an intrinsic (genetic maybe?) property of mankind to get an agreement, a social consensus, on behalf of each individual' goal: autopoiesis (to reproduce him/herself).",

				"commentBody": "We are speaking on behalf of the millions of people, worldwide, who suffer lifetime's filled with constant \u2018vertigo\u2019 from a little known and very misunderstood disease, known as Meniere's disease. <br/><br/>Meniere\u2019s disease steals lives, leaving those unable to function as they once did. Many sufferers are reduced to bystanders to their own existence, unable to work, drive, attend family gatherings, or simply play with their kids. Meniere\u2019s causes dizziness, severe vertigo, tinnitus, sensitivity to light and sounds and other normal everyday activities. Meniere\u2019s attacks leave their victims so dizzy and unable to walk or balance, with even the slightest movement bringing hours of nausea and vomiting. If that wasn\u2019t enough, most Meniere\u2019s sufferers develop hearing loss and many go completely deaf.<br/><br/>Additionally, in a 2009 study on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) performed by Kirby, S.E. and Yardley, L. it was found that the incidence of  (PTSD) and health anxiety is much higher than in non-sufferers. Nearly one in eight people with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s were found to meet the criteria for full PTSD, compared to the general population where just one in sixty has PTSD. Yet, Meniere\u2019s remains relatively unknown worldwide and dramatically underfunded when it comes to crucial research dollars.  <br/><br/>Please help by signing our petition for U2 Meniere's Awareness:<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/bono-and-u2-meniere-s-disease-raise-awareness\" title=\"https://www.change.org/p/bono-and-u2-meniere-s-disease-raise-awareness\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.change.org/p/bono-and-u2-meniere-s-disease-raise-awareness</a>",

He did a quick exam and told me what it was and sent me off to a Physical Therapist that specializes in treatment of BPPV. The PT laid me on a table and moved my head in a few specific ways more or less rolling it a bit very gently and within 10 minutes I felt amazing.  I think she referred to it as an Epley maneuver. This was maybe 10 years ago and I've never had a reoccurrence of the vertigo. BTW I am a long ago sufferer of Menieres Disease which the same doctor \"cured\" me of with injections of gentamiacin. I suffered from Menieres off and on for 25 years and those shots virtually took the symptoms away. I am a blessed man ",

It's also important that dangerous causes of vertigo be ruled out. This can only be done by a trained physician and is no easy task. Many strokes are missed, as the article mentions. But vertigo can be caused by \"central\" causes like tumors or MS. Even diabetic crises can cause vertigo. So, please see a doctor. Sometimes imaging will be necessary, and sometimes not. But don't do Epley or 1/2 somersault until BPPV has been diagnosed by a physician. Thanks everyone.",

The building where El Tiempo used to be was designed by an Italian architect, Bruno Violi. Opposite El Banco de La Republica is La Iglesia de San Francisco, and below that was the Gobernacion de Cundinamarca with a statue of Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada, the city founder. Going North on the Carrera Septima, just past El Banco de La Republica is El Parque de Santander. Beyond that is the Avianca tower which in years past housed the main post office.

				"commentBody": "Right, George Blackford.  It's simple math: if money is drained out of the demand system by people who don't spend (i.e., billionaires and sub-billionaires), it won't be spent on demand and demand will be reduced.  If the people who aren't getting that money already had enough and wouldn't be spending it anyway, there would be no reduction in demand.  By looking at the world, or just the U.S., as it is, any person can see that people who are losing money to the drainage are losing money they would mostly spend.<br/><br/>It follows that we have to take back our money from the (sub)billionaires.  If we elect real people instead of greed robots, we can make that happen.  Aye, there's the rub!",

Mr. Clinton was caught between the British, French and those who wee doubtful of it possibilities.<br/><br/>The problem as we have seen several times is the actions of other Islamic governments like Qatar. These governments have a history of saying one thing and doing another, then denying it. they are duplicitous and have an agenda that does not promote political stability in the region. <br/><br/>So the issue to start with was, let Qaddafi kill several thousand civilians, non combatants, or intervene and stop the slaughter of innocents? There was no right answer. Clinton did what she believed to be morally right, and if she had not, she would be getting the dame criticism anyway. Qaddafi had murdered Americans, among others, then began cooperating to save his own skin. He would have continued to do as he had been doing anyway.<br/><br/>Worse yet Libya had no formal government tradition, and there was no way to establish one. So each little faction wants to establish their own power center. <br/><br/>It was a no win situation, I think she did what she thought was the right thing to do. All the critics have 20-20 hindsight, but we do not know what they would have don in the same position. It is easy to criticize when you do not have to make the decision.",
