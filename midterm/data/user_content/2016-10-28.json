				"commentBody": "The writer conveniently forgets that Willie Randolph's tenure, was marked by talented teams that fell apart in 2007 and 2008, notable September collapses that might impair his future employability as a manager. Mr. Randolph was followed by another minority manager, Jerry Manuel, who had less talented squads and was less successful. During this time, the Mets' GM was Omar Minya, a Latino gentleman from Corona. To pick on the Mets is simply unfair and inaccurate. It is more than possible that other teams should consider promoting the black coaches they have for running the major league franchise. If every team was as fair-minded as the Wilpons, who own the Mets, in minority coach hiring, this article would not be written.",

I do add that the article documents a serious problem if you like watching a sport whose corporate structure you'd like to have respect for (to answer another commenter who says \"who cares?\"). Other Mets minority coaches include Sandy Alomar Sr, Sandy Alomar Jr and currently Tom Goodwin. I expect I'm leaving someone out. It's just odd, a NY newspaper singling out the Mets on the topic,  and not mentioning our Yankees. The Yankees did have Bob Watson do a terrific job as General Manager but that ended 20 years ago. I'm probably leaving someone out, but Tony Pena was considered but passed over as field manager and his transition from bench coach to first base coach (I don't understand how that's not a demotion) suggests he's not going to be considered again. Pena has a major league managing resume to go with the respect he earned as NYY bench coach (not from the team  apparently). I hope he gets another chance somewhere.",

What makes all the difference is having common goals: meeting that deadline, coming in at or under budget, finding and fixing that coding problem, etc. If we want to build something in this country, we can. And we don't have to be besties to do it. We DO have to define our common goals and put our minds into achieving them. We DO have to act like adults. For some people, that seems to be impossible. ",

(We could not pin him down on his age, but knew he was telling the truth. Daddy didn't give him millions when he turned 21.)<br/><br/>It scares me that otherwise smart people, mostly men, support Trump.

My question to the author would be how he can respect an educated man who believes Trump would do a good job of running the country?

Yes, outside of politics your friend may be a great guy, but ultimately he is making an extremely reckless choice that directly affects the rest of us.
