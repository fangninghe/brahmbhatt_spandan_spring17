				"commentBody": "It scarcely matters what Bernie had to say on the subject of Hillary Clinton.  The most important thing on which the two of them- and the great majority of Bernie's supporters- agree is that Donald Trump must never become President.  We've just experienced a taste of what happens when America loses its mind and lets hatred take over.  Anyone who still believes that what this country really needs is a man who feasts on hate and exploits our worst impulses for his own selfish purposes needs to consult a shrink or a cleric as absolutely soon as possible.  And any progressive who seriously considers  sitting out the next election to demonstrate their pique or their \"purity\" might just as well announce that black lives DON'T matter- not to mention those of Muslims, Latinos, gays, pregnant women, American Indians and whoever else is on The Donald's hit list.

And let's face it-- even if he loses in November, he's going to be up to his neck in Trump U.'s civil fraud case very soon, and likely a criminal one at some point as well. <br/><br/>You know, some people get to a point in their life where they just don't care about the repercussions and implications of their words. It's usually long past retirement time when you see this happen, and though I've not seen evidence before this that she's been at her job too long, I now think that leaving the bench soon would be a good idea. Hopefully, this will be done under a president who'll nominate a reasonable replacement for her.",
