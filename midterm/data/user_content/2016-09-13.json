				"commentBody": "There was no urgent reason for HRC to explain what happened any more quickly than she did. The election isn't tomorrow.<br/><br/>Any one of us could drop dead the next day. Any one of us could be diagnosed with cancer six months from now. Donald Trump could have a fatal heart attack a year from now. So could a man 20 years his junior. Both HRC and Trump have amply demonstrated they have the stamina to be president, so enough of the thinly veiled ageism. And I won't be the only one to mention FDR and JFK as examples of presidents overcoming physical conditions to excel at leadership.<br/><br/>If a candidate is likely to die or become incapacitated during their first year or two in office, then yeah, we need to know. If a candidate has early symptoms of Alzheimer's, or some other condition or illness likely to affect their mental fitness, we need to know. Otherwise, I really don't want the candidate stepping up to the podium and telling us about their latest attack of shingles, or the consistency of their bowel movements, or that darned herpes that's been recurring since college. Standards are different for a sitting president because we have to know who's in charge at all times and functioning at full capacity.<br/><br/>The call for \"transparency\" has become a perverse demand that candidates expose themselves like Kardashians. Maybe that's why we feel we aren't getting the candidates we need. What decent person wants to be subjected to this kind of scrutiny? DIgnity requires some level of privacy.",

Best wishes to her and her family.<br/>But secondly, let's make sure she doesn't have the same fate as William Henry Harrison, the ninth President of the United States.<br/>He was 68 years, 23 days old when inaugurated, the oldest president to take office until Ronald Reagan in 1981 and he was also the first president to die in office.<br/>Harrison died on his 32nd day in office of complications from pneumonia, serving the shortest tenure in United States presidential history.<br/>Harrison's death revealed the flaws in the constitution's clauses on presidential succession, sparking a brief constitutional crisis. Due to the death of Harrison, three Presidents served within a single calendar year (Martin Van Buren, Harrison, Tyler)<br/>Harrison's grandson, Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, was the 23rd president, from 1889 to 1893, making them the only grandparent\u2013grandchild pair of Presidents.<br/><br/>Let's hope the election of Hillary Clinton will not spark another constitutional crisis because more revelations about her shady dealings with the Clinton Foundation come to light after her potential inauguration (or a myriad of other possible revelations), making the only husband-wife pair of Presidents the first ones to be both impeached while in office.<br/><br/>If there is anything in the bushes and the Clinton campaign knows about it, now would be the perfect opportunity for a gracious exit, instead of another stumble like the one we witnessed yesterday",

				"commentBody": "It's one of the curious absurdities of the presidential politics of the USA that the health of the candidates is put under the microscope. There's a lot of justification behind it: The candidate has to be physically and mentally fit to formulate and execute policies from the point of campaign through the terms of office.<br/>The Americans rightly demand transparency because in the past, most notably in the cases of Roosevelt and Kennedy, the medical report on their physical condition was hidden from the public. In the 2016 election cycle, Trump has cleverly played up the health, appearance and stamina issue of his opponents. He called Jeb Bush a low energy person, mocked at Carly Fiorina's appearance and questioned Hillary's stamina much before.<br/>It's quite possible the hectic marathon-like running around must have taken its toll on Hillary's health. At one time when she was the Secretary of the State, she did suffer from some ailment that must have weakened her system. After all, in her late 60's, she shouldn't have the same energy as that of Obama.<br/>The tolerable level of ailment in the candidates, therefore, must not upset the American voters, and they are unlikely to be swayed by the news of Hillary's health. There's a succession procedure in place, her followers will stick with her. It may, however, create whispering campaign in the Republican circles.<br/>The tall world figures like Mao, Brezhnev, Khomeini, Deng Ping, Ho Chi Minh were all old and suffered from some ailment. ",

If the media were indeed balanced in their coverage, as they claim, of both candidates, much more attention would (and should) be focused on Trump's tax returns, questionable business arrangements, and his never ending derogatory sexist, ageist, racist, homophobic, and xenophobic language.<br/>Yes, journalists are required to be balanced and objective in their reporting, but not at the expense of the truth, especially when Trump's blatant lies and lack of presidential behavior seem to be given a kid glove pass by ALL media outlets, including the NYT. Would any presidential candidate in the past be allowed to continue his campaign after repeated compliments to and of  dictators? One could argue that this imbalance of fair and reasonable media coverage is in large part because one of the party nominees is a woman. The 21st century and sexist seems still to reign supreme . . .",
