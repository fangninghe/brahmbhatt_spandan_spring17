				"commentBody": "I have looked at Sanders's twitter feed several times and seen only posts by Sanders and campaign re-tweets of news items, etc, all of which was above board.<br/><br/>I just looked again and noticed something for the first time, since I am not a twitter user. Some posts have a link to \"view converation.\" Hitting that link opens up a thread of posts by all the lunkheads who use twitter. Welcome to cesspool of the internet.<br/><br/>There are multiples ugly posts in those conversations on the Sanders feed. Thing is, if you go to the Clinton feed and find her posts with \"view conversation links, you land in the same cesspool.<br/><br/>The feeds by the campaigns are more or less like the debates. Similar charges and countercharges.<br/><br/>The posts by internet trolls are the cesspool of the internet, and that has no more to do with Sanders than it does Clinton. Open an unmoderated comment section and expect behavior that makes Trump seem like Miss Manners.<br/><br/>So it is not exactly the smear I thought Krugman was making. It is a slightly different smear: \"Sanders invented the bad parts of the internet!\" Kind of like how Al Gore invented the whole thing",

				"commentBody": "Bill Clinton wisely read Trump as not someone who would go down without a fight.  Fight him our great USA democracy.  Fight him.  That being said.  We are a country with more light around her because we are based on the ideal of justice.  We believe in evidence.  Out justice system is based on substantiated evidence furthered by argument.  The foundation of our country is good and great.  There are a lot of dangerous people in the world.  With much regret I see Trump as a threat to all Americans world wide.  We would be targets by his provocative language.  Me as a mother and worker would not wish to bring this unleashing of reaction to our people.  I look to the future and Trump in his eagerness to gain power forgot that the world watches.  A Trump presidency would risk all our sons and daughters in future wars brought on by his racist language.  What brought me courage were the Obamas and the Trudeau families peacefully mixing in wonderful elegance.  That vision is what I hold onto for my family's future.  I pray for our country at this dark hour.  I hope that we can hold the foundation of this country through the changes in the next 50 years.  My vote will go to someone who would not risk our country to get a cheap vote.  My vote of course goes to Hillary Clinton who would never harm the country in order to get a vote.  ",
