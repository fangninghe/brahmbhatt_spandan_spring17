				"commentBody": "\"Once knowledge and goodness were divorced, scientists could be regarded as experts, but there are no morals or lessons to be drawn from their work. Science derives its authority from impersonal structures and methods, not the superior character of the scientist. The individual scientist is no different from the average Joe; he or she has, as Shapin has written, \u201cno special authority to pronounce on what ought to be done.\u201d For many, science became a paycheck, and the scientist became a \u201cde-moralized\u201d tool enlisted in the service of power, bureaucracy and commerce.\" Naturally, professors are referred to as instructors, if not customer service reps, while students are consumers, customers, and fans. No wonder tribalistic college sports, not knowledge, seems the strongest \"glue\" and \"unity\" cohering the diverse academic units, creating a sense of self-worth and identity. I feel that we need philosophers in every corner on and off campus more than ever to restore the beliefs and values that led to the birth of universities in the first place during the Dark Ages. ",

D'Alien's comment should really have been answered by a specialist in medieval history. What I'm protesting against is the facile, ill-informed claim that the entire span of time from 476 (when the last Roman emperor in the West died) to the beginning of the Renaissance was \"dark,\" meaning shrouded in ignorance.",

To my knowledge there is no definite right or wrong answer to a person's philosophy, it comes from ones perspective. You may have one idea that i completely disagree with but that does not make either of us wrong, so if philosophers were all around who has the right to determine what each philosopher should demonstrate? What standard would we hold these philosophers to or are they free to explain their own ideals of their philosophy? I do agree there needs to be more of a place for philosohy, but I feel that society is not ready to accept what current philosophers have to offer.",

It's their own fault for using alliteration. Magical Mystery Tour, Polythene Pam, Rocky Raccoon, Please Please Me, Sexy Sadie.  It's kind of a shame, because \"Sell! Oh, Yubmarine!\", the cry of someone needing to raise funds at an auction, would be a spanner if it made a shred of sense.<br/><br/>I've had little success with album titles. Abbey Road is out because you need 2 consonants. \"Subber Roll\"? No. \"Beat the ****les\"? Won't pass standards.<br/><br/>Others I considered:<br/>Juror for Lebowski? \"Peer Dudence\" [again, makes no sense]<br/>Ache for Coach Wilkens? \"Lennie Pain\" [it's open to complaints about sports clues despite the fact that the man transcended his sport]<br/>\"Comoro Never Tows\" or \"Komoro Never Tows\" would seem to me an unfair generalization about car mechanics in the named places.

They were the ones who were pushing their clients into holding bad equity that they knew was bad,  even as they staked out positions betting against their clients.<br/><br/>It is not surprising that Cruz is linked to them or that he would hide from the public a loan such as it is while claiming to be a populist.
