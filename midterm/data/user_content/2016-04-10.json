At night the moon awakens me so that I can view her beauty and that of her handmaids, the stars, and those naughty clouds who try to spoil the scene like some vaporous streaker. If I were an architect I would design houses with \"sleeping bubbles\"....rooms just a little larger than the bed, surrounded by windows like a green house. ",

The year was 1984, my twenty-something enthusiasm envisioned the day that people would live in homes in the community, receive quality health care and be given the opportunity to be a friend and have friends too. That year my boss wrote in the annual performance evaluation as an area to work on \"get your head out of the clouds and more down to earth with your thinking.\"  Sometimes are assumptions are for better futures. Over three decades later, my work allows me to visit, talk with and assess the quality of services these individuals enjoy for the most part.  \"We all need to be more like that man.\"",

				"commentBody": "From a related NYT piece on Sanders win in Wyoming comes this:\" Its more diverse population and its more traditional primary method of voting make the state friendlier territory for Mrs. Clinton.\" The reference is of course to New York and its upcoming primary. What is going on on both sides of the aisle is an announcement that the political system and process of selection and election are corrupted by money and relationships which leave the \"People\" out.<br/><br/>But more dramatic is the falsehoods presented by candidates worth $130,000,000; living in an area where the population is 90% white, less than 1% African-American, 5% Asian and the rest Hispanic, etc. and claiming that you can best represent minorities.<br/><br/>In that same neighborhood the average income is $198,000 and the median home sale price is about $1,240,000 and is ranked 42nd among the top 100 highest income areas in the USA and 317th on the Forbes wealthiest areas. <br/><br/>Reports indicate that the Clintons are worth $130,000,000 and live in a home purchased in 1999 for about $1,700,000. The other guy it is reported after 40 years of service in government is worth about $700,000<br/><br/>So the super PACs have sponsors and those sponsors give big bucks and the big buck takers are beholden to them. Should you not believe that, go to Wall Street and ask for $625,000 to give three secret speeches or ask the super bundlers for $270,000.<br/><br/>Rich people give money to get a return; to get something back.<br/><br/>The super delegates are no different.",

This is becoming evident in this party election process as well, where these super delegates are the chosen representatives of the people in partial.

Most specifically I'd guess they are all over 37.  There is a harsh dividing line between Sanders and Clinton based on age, and what the candidates provide.  And by simple stature or lifetime wisdom inherent in these supposed superdelegates, they fall to the older side, and thus much more likely to side with Clinton.   If superdelegates were spread across the age demographic, 18-65, I think we'd see a broader split.",

I think we need to insist that people aged 28 to 39 have a much greater voice in both political parties. I think it also grossly distorting that we have a system where you 'graduate' from elected position to position and thus almost all US senators are aged over 50. Perhaps one senator from each state needs to be a 'young' senator meaning that when elected they are not aged over 40. The other one can be over any age and we need to change the constitution to allow anyone to be a US Senator above she 18.<br/><br/>The whole issue of superdelegates begs a much larger question. Why should there be a system that so distorts the will of the people by having superdelegates, caucases that make participation very hard for most, and a system where we elect 'delegates'. It's time to modernize an eighteenth century model and have primaries that are directly proportionate to the number of votes cast, albeit at staggered intervals as is currently done. If one person achieves over 50% of the total votes vast they become the nominee. Otherwise we should have a national runoff primary election between all candidates who have obtained above 25% of the vote where the winner subsequently becomes the nominee. All votes should be weighed equally. Anything less is undemocratic.",
