				"commentBody": "I like Starbucks and drink their coffee at home that I purchase at the supermarket. I don't live near a store so frequenting one is not an option however when I travel I will find a local Starbucks for my morning coffee and look for one at the airport and even bring a bag with me. I have enjoyed the rewards program. It is great to be appreciated for being a customer and being brand loyal by corporate America. I don't drink the fancy drinks to many calories and silliness I prefer my coffee straight up.<br/><br/>But if customers are double dipping by splitting up purchases or ripping tags off of bags and it hurts profit margins then I get it. It is still important for employees to make a living wage and have health insurance. And Starbucks is still better coffee then DD or McD and many people hang out all day using the wifi and the bathrooms so there you have it -- it costs money to keep a business open.",
