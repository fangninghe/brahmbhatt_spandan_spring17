We just had an electoral debacle partly because of too many un-employed, under-employed or under-paid voters in an economy that is \"the best ever.\"<br/><br/>Job creation is never an objective of a capitalist--and today providing goods (and many services) can be done with very few jobs. When Facebook bought WhatsApp, it shelled out $22 billion for a company with only 55 staff -- a cool $400 million per employee. We can be sure that a very few of the 55 staff realized even $1 million, never mind $400 million.<br/>Once the incremental labor costs to produce products is almost free, almost everyone needs to be providing a service--and our need for services is badly outstripped by those willing to provide them (except where protected by monopolies like doctors) so the wages stay low.<br/>We need models that show us how to run an economy and provide enough income to citizens. Our current economy takes almost all of our productivity gains for the top .1 percent. The net is an economy with high inflation in goods like high end travel, or paintings by dead artists, but low inflation in more basic goods targeted to the 90%, and real hardship for an increasing percentage of our population.<br/>Prof. Krugman's note points out that a simple model predicted some things not to do -- that were done anyway with the predicted bad results. We need to also see modeling of specific policies, like increasing the minimum wage. C",

It's a broad brush that can't possibly cover  education, social and political policies in a country with 5x the population of the United States.  For one thing, the education is varied and sophisticated, with plenty of options for a broad education if desired by parents or brighter students.  Why would anyone think, for example, that China's leadership, would stop their best students from learning about the world in their formative years?  In my experience, students here are quite comfortable with being Chinese, and if they go to the US or Europe for education, most are going to enhance their education with the expectation of remaining Chinese.  We can acknowledge that some people are leaving for ideological reasons, but most people leaving China are doing so to protect their money. In other words, the system has more controls on its population than the United States, but this type of article fails to acknowledge that Chinese people have options",

Even those countries feeling imposed on by the China Sea issue do not see China as a threat, nor does the business sector in America, a view not shared by the working class in many cases. The Chinese Communist Party had become not only the darling of Wall Street but banker to the world. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to advance its own agenda. The AIIB is budgeted to spend about ten times as much in Asia as the Marshall Plan did in Europe, mostly to finance roads, railways, pipelines, electricity transmission, and other connectivity across Eurasia to smooth its own westward expansion.<br/>China is trading infrastructure construction for the natural resources it desires. Few see that as threatening. Can American perception catch up with what is happening?",

In the meanwhile, China would have a range of retaliatory options for US  tariffs, far beyond raising their tariffs on American imports; for example, sharply increasing export duties on the many materials needed by American manufacturers to function, or, say, on semiconductors. At the far end of responses, the Chinese government could require that contracts entered into after a certain date be settled in RMB. I doubt there is any precedent for a trade war where one side has previously abandoned so much of its domestic production of goods and materials.",
