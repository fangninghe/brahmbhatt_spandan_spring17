For as long as I can remember, politicians have scared us into submission with constant references to the \"dangerous world\" that we live in, and from which only they can protect us. For a grotesque example of this kind of fear-mongering, take a look at the GOP debates.<br/>Sanders appears to have no desire, nor any inclination to use fear to manipulate us. He understands that we cannot afford to maintain both an empire (which prioritizes the prerogatives of the military/industrial complex) and a democracy (which is chiefly concerned with promoting the welfare of the citizenry), and like everyone except the military/industrial complex and big media, he chooses the latter.

She interupted Bernie consistently, didn't ask but went forth to comment on just about everything he said, without the Moderators stepping in.    She was forceful and determined to get in list after list of her accomplishments and deeds....   Very poor Moderation in this sense.   They asked good tough questions, which is great.... but simply gave the platform largely to Hillary.   Yes, Bernie isn't the kind of guy to grab it, or cut her off, and he shouldn't have to.   \"Brutally caustic\", may have applied to much of Hillary's early statements, but there was also a fair amount of civility shown in this debate, especially by Bernie and by both towards the very end.   Having over 40 years indepth health care experience here in nyc, I feel everything Bernie has said to be based on facts and realities.  We're fortunate in him.",

Long before candidates entered the second half of the debate, the tone became almost too civil on both sides. I think they both realized they were being set up for a semantic food fight. And thanks to the subsequent relative dearth of \"gotchas\" by the moderators, I was able to learn a lot more about their positions. They actually spoke in complete, uninterrupted paragraphs. What a refreshing change from the boilerplate soundbites we've come to expect from the GOP's fascist clowns.<br/><br/>If you happened to miss the debate and were relying solely upon this article for a recap, you were sadly misled. Clinton did not launch a harshest of all harsh attacks on Sanders. If anything, she disingenuously overreacted to his correct observation that Wall Street has an outsize influence on politicians and his call to do away with the legalized bribery of Citizens United.<br/><br/>Yet the opening paragraph of this piece would have you believe that Clinton destroyed Sanders in one fell swoop. Huh?<br/><br/>This is the Times doing what it does best: diminishing/attacking Bernie Sanders through the same insinuation and innuendo that Clinton ascribed to her opponent. It's a terminal case of journalistic OCD, and apparently highly resistant to the usual therapy of fairness and accuracy.<br/><br/>For a clear picture, simply watch the debate or read the transcript.",

She has a problem of dropping names of people from the past, like Henry Kissinger, who she said praised her. She states how she wants to continue what Obama has done, most likely to win minority voters. Yet on foreign policy she fails to be accountable to the current state of chaos in the region. She voted for the Iraq invasion and was Secretary of State for four years. Incoherent to say how her years as Secretary of State did not contribute to the current chaos in the region. She'll take credit from anyone but not assume accountability. Someone that only takes credit but is not accountable will be like having George W. Bush again; she also has praised George W. Bush. She clearly is the establishment candidate. In previous town hall she disrespected the youth asking questions about being dishonest. She seems to think by having been through the wringer that she will enjoy that same type of battle; instead of bringing opposing sides together. She appears to speak a language of the past and sounds not current, both in her proposed plans and in the way she speaks. Hard to see how she would energize the base, youth, and minorities. She should have said Sanders was electable in a general election. And should release the transcripts of her paid for speeches. She seems to whine at the slightest comment.

But Clinton has learned from the past few years, and only the Republicans haven't.  We live in a world vastly different from the one we lived in twenty or so years ago, in some ways better and in some ways worse.  We have to be ready to deal with the world we live in today, and also the one we will live in tomorrow.  Of course it helps to remember the past and how many people voted for the Tonkin Gulf resolution or to impeach President (Andrew) Johnson.  We can avoid making yesterday's mistakes tomorrow.",

							"commentBody": "What has Clinton learned more recently. She keeps talking about rubbing shoulders with Kissinger, Bush, and whoever might give her status by association. Since she now is glued to Obama, quite the opposite when she criticized him in 2008, using some of the same lightweight comments she now does against Sanders, what influence did she have on the current problems/policies in Iraq, Iran, and the other Mideast countries. After all, she keeps talking about how much experience she has. Did she influence any of Obama's current policies as Secretary of State. She keeps saying she had influence when Obama gave the orders against Bin Laden. There is an iconic photo where she is in the same room. By the looks of her expression she appeared to not be confident about going after Bin Laden. Are there transcripts of what role she played in that decision. Otherwise, being near or at the decision-making point doesn't necessarily mean you made the decisions. If she were to win the primary, she is going to have to own up to wrapping herself around Obama in the general election. It will be hard to pivot and disclaim all being said now about how in agreement she now appears to be with Obama, both on domestic issues/policies/programs and on foreign issues/policies/program. ",

				"commentBody": "New York Times have already sided with the establishment candidate even though they know better.<br/><br/>Now they are trying to justify their choice by labeling (mislabeling) Bernie supporters as gullible idealistic youth. <br/><br/>I am a Bernie supporter abut I am not that young. The establishment spin masters criticize Bernie's plans as farfetched/pie in the sky etc. <br/><br/>In the Federal Budget there is more than enough money to do what Bernie is advocating, a re apportionment of priorities is necessary to balance our budget. Maybe some Senators/Congressmen would have to forego 'bridge to nowhere' etc. <br/><br/>Free college education is something that was given right here in the most populous State of the Union California not too long ago. <br/><br/>Re single payer healthcare delivery system, it is being practiced in many OECD countries and with good results at much lower cost.<br/><br/>One thing for sure, our youth is much more educated at this age with smart phones and VR platforms than we were at their age. Please my cohorts give them credit for their easy access to facts and quick decision making prowess.",

				"commentBody": " With all due respect sir, there is no need to try scaring people into voting for Clinton over future terrorist threats. That is exactly what Republicans do, in particular what Bush and Cheney did to win back the White House in 2004. Both the Republicans and Hillary Clinton, with her 3am phone call ad, tried this tactic to derail President Obama, and obviously there have been no attacks launched at the USA on his watch.<br/>No, this is not the 1930's and Sanders is not FDR. This is 2016 when income inequality, perhaps the defining issue of our time, is worse than it was in the roaring 20's. I don't believe Secretary Clinton, with her deep connections to Wall Street, has the right stuff to take on these huge injustices. Bernie Sanders is that person.",
