				"commentBody": "Liberals are desperate?  Which party has a nominee who is unable to control what flows from his brain to his mouth?  And which party has tried to pass laws that are against the Constitution in that they allow discrimination against people who may be part of the LGBTQ community because it could offend a business owners religious beliefs?  And who is it that keeps on saying climate change isn't happening in spite of evidence saying it is?  And let's not forget who shut down the government.  <br/><br/>Richard Luettgen, if you want to know which party is in trouble it's the red neck party of useless prattlers, also known as the GOP.  And liberal, while used as a pejorative by many could be applied to the GOP.  They are very liberal in their prejudices, intrusiveness into women's reproductive lives, worship of the NRA, and subservience to their rich donors.  The Republicans of today do not care about the average American.  The fact that a Donald Trump ever made it to the point of being their nominee shows how far the GOP has fallen.  My one hope is that it falls further so that it has to either collapse completely or regroup and accept that not everyone is the 1%.",

				"commentBody": "It's extremely difficult to speculate which modern religion, if any, may answer this question. First, similar to the United States Constitution, you cannot (or should not) look in total to the founding fathers or in this case founding Father for uncontested guidance. The Father in question might even be retired or dead. Therefore, Jesus, today, probably could not (or should not) rely upon a traditional, personal God to direct his way. Moreover, I don't think Buddha's way fills the quest--too much personal, possibly self-interest, in the search for individual \"unconditional happiness.\" Having faith/belief in science, beyond the material world, doesn't accomplish much either so I don't suggest that direction for him. Possibly he might step into the uncertainty--more accurately the confusion of philosophical reasoning but beware of false ideas. There's the \"golden rule\" which I strongly recommend. Further, I saw a quote by literary critic Harold Bloom offering much wisdom. He said: \" Only dualism, the distinction between Ideal forms and ordinary realities, is truth for Plato's Socrates.\" In short, maybe one has to return to the spoken words of each Jesus and Socrates for help and direction.

				"commentBody": "That's right - Jesus was a Jew, and I've seen it said that all of his authentic sayings were consistent with the Judaism of his time, which is not identical with the Judaism of today (no Talmud, no rabbinical writings, etc.). The true founder of Christianity was Saul of Tarsus, aka St. Paul, and I wonder what Jesus would have thought of some of Paul's teachings.<br/><br/>The message of religion is a moral one, that we should treat other people as we ourselves would want to be treated - yes it's just the Golden Rule. But applying it in practice seems to be anything but simple, because it aims to transcend some very deep-seated negative tendencies in human nature: rejecting the outsider, domination of the weak by the strong, \"rule or die\", etc. So we tend to ignore the message and venerate the messenger instead, meanwhile continuing with the \"business as usual\" of wealth, strife and idolatry.",

				"commentBody": "I would argue your points thusly<br/>1) You say \"If the economy is at full capacity, no economist would advocate a deficit spending increase.\"  Fed chairperson Yellen is so convinced the economy is near full capacity she is anxious to raise interest rates.  Krugman on the other hand argues for greater fiscal stimulus, beyond Clinton's plan, and partly funded by deficit spending.  I readily concede the real argument is over whether the economy is in fact at full capacity.  But thus instead of \"no economist\", it is Krugman and many others advocating.<br/>2) Instead of nobody, I think both Krugman and Sims do in fact argue over the short term effect of deficit spending on inflation and not about debt reduction caused by long term inflation.<br/>3) Normal inflation or moderate inflation over the long term may help working people with debt if and only if their interest are locked in low rates and their salaries keep up with the inflation.  Short term higher inflation will nearly hurt the worker because wages don't keep up, and this will offset gains from reduced debt.  His leverages asset appreciates, so does the replacement cost.  But his reduced real wage remains devalued for years.<br/>Taxes to reduce debt can favor the worker much more than inflation.  Inflation is essentially a regressive tax, whereas taxes are progressive.<br/>Since the end of WWII govt debt reduction came from inflation and taxes (60 -40).<br/>I do agree VAT is evil, regressive, and shutter when Krugman endorses.",
