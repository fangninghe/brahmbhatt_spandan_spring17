Anyway, my question to you was not facetious; something in the back of my brain was bugging me. I've finally remembered what.<br/><br/>Many years ago, I had occasion to ask an employee in a New York State Court what rank would be next above the Major (uniformed Court Officer) I had just been speaking to. Her answer was \"Chief\"; but it's conceivable that she meant the (non-uniformed) Chief -- who worked in her building -- was next in line above that particular major. That is, maybe other uniformed ranks exist but no one in that building had achieved that rank. The rank directly superior to a Major in the New York State Police is an Inspector of some type (\"Staff Inspector\"?).<br/><br/>This came back to me after taking random looks at other nations' military ranks. The clue specifies nothing about the uniform worn by the Maj., but I didn't find any situation in which a uniformed Maj. is ranked directly (serially) below COL. (The clue for COL can't use \"Lt. Col.\" or any form thereof, by custom.)<br/><br/>Now, if a COL is the highest rank of \"senior officer\" (as I read), what is the lowest rank of senior officer (in our Army)?",

In hardship cases like the ones noted here, these same privateers, who have already profited immensely for pandering for the sale of these loans without equivalent disclosure of the downside conditions of these loans.  They should TARP these individuals, just as we taxpayers TARPed big biz in 2008.<br/><br/> And it should be noted that some of these entities have never fully repaid their TARP loans. And for the biggest, i.e. Goldman and Morgan Stanley, the fed allowed  them to become retail banks to derive benefits therefrom, and allowed many of them to borrow at infinitesimal overnight short term rates, for their private investments. And instead of loaning out the bulk of these retail deposits back to main street tp actually grow our economy, only 15% goes to main street loans.  The rest, 85% goes to their book, for their personal investment profits.  That is why our economy is not growing.  Who would've thought they would be decent, at least once in awhile.",

				"commentBody": "My father worked for a large brewery as a maintenance supervisor, a similar job to Michelle Obama's father, with almost exact same pay, $55k in 1977 which is almost $250k in today's $.<br/><br/>The brewery could pay him that kind of money because they had high tech, high automation, high speed canning equipment. Not only did he get high pay but everyone that worked there, thousands of people, made a high wage. In turn they spent it on housing, feeding, clothing, educating and raising their families, which pushed the money out into services in the surrounding area.<br/><br/>The issue is not technology and never was, it is the distribution of bargaining power &amp; the associated distribution of wages that go with it.<br/><br/>America is more productive than it has ever been: more than double 1977.  The problem is all those gains are going to the top 1% and they can only buy so many goods &amp; services for themselves so the wealth is concentrated up at the top.<br/><br/>This is the classic problem going all the way back to the Roman empire &amp; Ancient Egypt's New Kingdom.<br/><br/>Bargaining power has at least two levels: macro and micro. Micro is the bargaining power distribution between you and your employer, macro is the power your class of cohorts manifests in the making of laws in congress. The two combined determine the distribution of wealth: thru wages, thru taxation, thru monetary policy (inflation forces investors to not sit on their money but invest it in order to get a return &amp; demand allows them to get a return.",

My private insurance (Group Health of Puget Sound) does not give me the individual attention the VA does. By that I mean the VA requires that I come in once a year for a physical. They send the two medications that I take directly to my house at much less cost than Group Health. The VA screened me upon registration for agent orange exposure (I served two tours in places where agent orange was prevalent.). This \"debat did three e\" is politically motivated. The debate is being engaged in primarily by people who have never seen the inside of a military uniform. Ask my son who did three tours of duty in Iraq and in other areas of the world we find ourselves in. Ask me and my fellow Vietnam vets. My guess is that they will go with the VA as is.",

When I was passing a kidney stone, they told me to wait in a room along, for 4 hours and told me that they were not giving me anything for the pain because that was what I wanted (I sure did, it HURT, but I wasn't a pain med user, don't even use alcohol or tobacco at all).  When a fell and broke my lower leg and hobbled into the VA ER the MD told me it couldn't be broken or I wouldn't be able to walk on it so sent me away without even an xray.  When I had it treated at a local hospital the VA refused to pay the bill because I should have gone to the local VA center.  When I ran a limbing saw over my left index finger, cutting it down to the bone, the VA center gave me a bandaid and a tetanus shot.  When I went to a local medical clinic and they closed the would with 9 stitches the VA refused to pay the bill because I was supposed to go to my local VA clinic for treatment.  And when I fell and tore the lateral and medial meniscus in my right knee that told me to go away, that they didn't find any value in treating that injury in fat men over 40.  I paid thousands for the surgery from a real medical services provider.  And on and on.  If you need an annual physical, pharmacy meds mailed or an annual flu shot, the VA is fine.  If you need real medical care, the VA Medical Malpractice Center is not the right place to be. ",
