Maybe something bad. Probably not soon, not sure exactly when. Maybe not much of anything. Best be prepared.

I added leftover kale, parsley, herbs, and shredded chicken from the fridge. I used a pre-shredded 3 cheese (fontina, parm and gouda) combo for affordability and ease from whole foods and whole milk ricotta. It fed 4 people with leftover and was delish. A versatile recipe, you could add crumbled bacon, zuke, and nuts if you want. Better than lasagne, in my opinion!",

Caucuses have very low turnout, so it is very easy for a small number of Fanatics to turn the tide there. This is how Obama repeatedly won caucuses even in states where he was losing among registered voters. If Sanders was on track to win on the national level, he should be winning in places like Nevada. Not by much, maybe, but he should be winning there.<br/>Now the situation starts to get tough. Sanders dramatically outspent (i.e. 2-1 and 3-1) Clinton in all three early states. He is going to get hammered in SC, and then on super tuesday. This will be a serious test of the morale of his supporters. Will they still be there in late March after he has a dizzying string of losses? Also, can he win in a state where spending is roughly equal? Sanders had three good states for him early on, and that was the chance to break Clinton's morale. It didn't work, now he has to face his own morale check, and we see if his forces get broken. If he survives, he can slog it out all the way to the convention, but he'll have to really start racking up major victories to make it. ",

Bernie uses extremism to pursue a lifelong socialist dream that is very far outside the mainstream -- and what's even sadder than Trump or Cruz, who know very well what choices they're making, he seeks a pyrrhic presidency without the slightest idea of how he would secure that lifelong dream as president.<br/><br/>Extremism.

Kasich won't be in the fight much longer, but Hillary still has a shot.

It follows, then, that everything that happened to this country between the years 2001 and 2008 was the fault of Bill and Hillary. And that Bush I should be given the credit for everything that was accomplished between 1992 and 2000. Seriously, do Republicans ever take responsibility for anything? Even one of their own?",

				"commentBody": "I have always hated cereal for breakfast.  Neither dry cereal nor cooked appealed in the least.  The closest I could ever come was rice with onions and a bit of sausage.  <br/><br/>It was kind of like my horror of sweet potatoes and winter squash until I tried them without the added sweet (brown sugar, marshmallows, whatever--yuck!).<br/><br/>But this sounds promising.  My husband eats oatmeal plain--no sugar, no salt, no nothing.  Same with steel cut oats.  I prefer my grain with a bit more flavor, so this might just be the thing.  Thanks.",

				"commentBody": "The author is absolutely not overreacting. This has been going on for years; kudos to Lynn Messina for drawing attention to it. This kind of pressure is what leads preteens to have sex and to commit suicide. A kid's job is to play; kids learn through play. There's plenty of time for girlfriends and boyfriends in high school. My kids were forbidden from having such relationships until they were sixteen; not to actually keep them from having such relationships, but to keep them from having such relationships because of outside pressure and to allow them to develop feelings in their own time. They didn't actually make it to sixteen before having a \"girl-/boy-friend,\" but they also didn't have to deal with it until they were ready. The same applies to heels and make-up and thongs and paintball guns and airsoft guns and driving in cars with teens; they need parents to set limits so they don't have to!",
