There is only one way to stop this unethical way of conducting business and that is to make it cost so much, make it hurt so much,  that  the public will think twice before buying stock in a company that is a moral. This is exactly what makes it difficult for everyone else's life to work out . Apparently, most people do not realize the direct cause and effect relationship.",

The article does not say that people are getting a credit against the price of a new VW.  Rather, it says that owners have the choice of getting their car fixed, or a buyback based on the pre-scandal KBB price.  Curious as to whether you saw something elsewhere that says the buyback is really only a credit.",

We haven\u2019t jailed Wall Street bankers for bringing down the world\u2019s economy, or GM for knowingly installing ignition switches that got people killed, so how can we now criminally prosecute VW managers and expect prison sentences? <br/><br/>5.\tUp to 40 times the amount of one type of pollution sounds like a lot but in the larger scheme of things these VW diesels are only about one in 500 of the passenger cars in the US. (255.8 million cars (Wikipedia) divided by less than 500,000 cheating diesels).  <br/><br/>In sum, yes, VW has violated the law and betrayed its customers and dealers big time and needs to pay for it but mass hysteria is not called for.",

The original base MSRP for a 2010 Jetta Golf was $19,000 to $26,000.  Pre-scandal Kelley Blue Book Price is ~$7,000 to $9,000.<br/><br/> VW is offering cash comp at $5,0000 to $10,000.  This is one the lowest price models meaning the owner is looking at getting~ $5,000 comp. That\u2019s a total of $12,000 to $14,000.  <br/><br/>Tell me.  What can I buy now with this total?  I\u2019m on a fixed social security income as a widow--my low 7 figure retirement is gone after the recession and my late husband\u2019s decision to play high risk games ALONG with Wall Street with my retirement?<br/><br/>I wanted to have a car with low emissions.  I thought I was getting it and was so happy when my emissions test turned out so well each year.  Now I find out that those yearly tests were a scam as VW\u2019s engineers figured out a way to criminally disguise those emission figures.  Those engineers should be censored by their professional organization.<br/><br/>Now what can I buy for that money?  The three \u201ccheapest\u201d 2016 all electric models are The Ford C, Prius, and Chevy Volt.  Base MSRP is ~$26,000.  I don\u2019t have the $14,000 extra!  That VW was going to be last car...and I live in an area with no public transportation--NOT my decision to end up here.<br/><br/>Maybe for you this seems like a \u201cgood deal,\u201d IT\u2019S NOT!

Never had (still don't) any intentions of selling it. If the mpg goes down from 45 to 40 or 35, fine.

So one might say that the abduction of Helen was the casus BELLI of the Trojan War. (I don't care whether it's proper Latin, because NYT is an English-language website!) An ironic feature of any supposed casus BELLI is that it is often an excuse for deploying military force rather than a cause. Remember the Maine, a ship that was not blown up by the Spanish except in the imaginations of people who wanted war.<br/><br/>As for EREBUS, the clue gave us two ways in. It's fairly standard for mythology to be the source of crossword entries. We also see the world's higher volcanoes often, as clues or as answers. That makes them good to know. The Maunas (LEA and Kea), Ararat, the nation where Kilimanjaro is found: Not only fair game but frequent. Solving puzzles in the Archives has been helpful to many Commenters; doing so can inform us of the variety of facts we might fruitfully explore. Moreover, EREBUS is on the storied Ross Island, familiar in geology, zoology, and the history of geographic exploration. It was explored by men traveling with the intrepid Sir Ernest Shackleton.<br/><br/>And although it's regretful, many of us have had DNFs on Mondays, Tuesdays, ... . Recent Tuesday puzzles have shown some resistance, for which I've repeatedly expressed gratitude.",

This was when people had a little insurance to bury themselves, but not enough to replace a lifetime of income. Also, home values were much lower (as were incomes). Anyway, to help keep them in their home, the local bank who still held the mortgage (which was customary back in the day) allowed the widow (with two children) to make only interest payments for a few years (not reducing the principle), until such time as she was able to obtain full-time employment and get back on financial track. I don't think that would ever happen today.<br/><br/>Admittedly, local banks also had the power to make mischief. I'm sure they were responsible for aiding institutionalized segregation by disallowing mortgages for certain people in certain neighborhoods. We definitely wanted that practice to go down the drain. However, it's unfortunate we're now in the position of having thrown the empathetic community-building baby out with the bath water.<br/><br/>I think strengthening community banks, definitely while correcting their faults, would have made us better neighbors. It just seems when almost any company gets too big and too far removed from the community it serves, the product or service to the client becomes an afterthought. Think cable company.",
