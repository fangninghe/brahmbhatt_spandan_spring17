							"commentBody": "The answer to your question about the requirement to pay by the hour is \"yes.\" People in low-wage jobs are paid hourly, and overtime is required to prevent employers from taking advantage of them. Creatively changing the pay scheme just to avoid the overtime is fraudulent and illegal, specifically because it takes advantage of the employee who is clearly in a weak negotiating position. Just because she says she is willing to forgo overtime in order to keep the job doesn't mean that choosing that route is legal or ethical. If she must stay late, overtime should be paid. That is the fair cost of labor. <br/><br/>It seems clear the letter writer actually understands all this, and even drew a clear boundary by taking the child into her own room so that the caretaker would be 'off the clock' while staying overnight. The $50 for staying over while off the clock was nice, but not necessary. The overtime is, and the case  would be the same if a caretaker with a shorter commute were hired instead.  That being the case, it then becomes much simpler to just keep the trusted caretaker, pay her overtime when she works over, and don't pay her when she is off the clock. For late nights, let her stay overnight off the clock. It's the decent thing to do.",

				"commentBody": "I think it's wise to listen to the signals a child gives about gender orientation without weighing in, consciously or unconsciously, in either direction. I'm disturbed by the trend toward \"acknowledging\" that children as young as five or six are definitely \"gender different.\" In my experience, it's just too soon to be sure. <br/><br/> One of our daughters began to refuse to wear girl clothing starting at age 2. From ages 2 through approximately 8 she was never in a dress; she repeatedly tried to learn to pee standing up; she insisted on a short haircut; and she strongly preferred playing with boy traditional toys over girl traditional toys. We followed her signals and let her do as she wished in every way.  We also consulted with a LGBTQ psychiatrist to talk about appropriately sensitive ways of nurturing her.<br/><br/> Starting at 7 to 8, she began to re-orient herself toward female traditional clothing, and activities.  We followed her signals. <br/><br/> Today, she is 16, and she is a cis teen girl  She is straight, and she seems to take pride in her now womanly body. <br/><br/>Please wait and see with openness. If your child starts to think that you have an \"expectation\" in either direction, your child can unconsciously try to meet your expectation. Just as you don't want to define your child prematurely in your own mind, you should also not prematurely echo or reinforce your child's self-definition, which may be a tentative experiment rather than a permanent identity.",

				"commentBody": "I'm in shock that the writer pays her babysitter legally at all. Except for those using au pair care, as I did, I didn't know anyone in Manhattan or the suburbs who paid their full-time babysitter on the books according to the law (my kids are now young adults). <br/><br/>I don't mean to suggest that I approve of paying off the books. I'm only commenting that it is rare among upper-middle-class professional families in the New York area, at least according to my own personal reference group. <br/><br/>In fact, I had a couple of friends who sought to pay on the books, but they could not get a babysitter to agree for either tax reasons or for immigration status reasons. <br/><br/>In any event, here's my advice to this admirably law-abiding parent:  if you can afford it, pay your babysitter at the overtime rate for the hours from 4 PM until you get home on Fridays, but don't pay her just to sleep at your house. <br/><br/>If you can't afford that even, or if the real issue is that you don't want her sleeping at your house, then I would have an  direct and open conversation with her telling her that you don't want to take advantage of her, but you just can't afford the extra cost to keep her on Friday night, so you'll have to use a local person at a lower rate for just those few hours when you get the opportunity to go out on Friday.",

Maybe not at the full rates, but something.

				"commentBody": "The author of the first letter purposefully refuses to use clear language. What, exactly, are the parents worried about? If they are worried about spending money in North Carolina because they disapprove of its politics, it shouldn't matter whether their children are gender-conforming, gender-nonconforming, or trans. Wrong is wrong, whether you are personally affected or not.<br/><br/>If the family is worried that J.G. might somehow be at risk because of the law, it matters whether J.G. is trans or simply gender-nonconforming. If the latter, I've got news for the parents: North Carolina, like every other state, has many little girls who dislike pink, long hair, and dresses, and many little boys who love pink ponies, sparkly clothing, and even (gasp!) dolls. No one would care about J.G.'s \"non-conformity.\" <br/><br/>If J.G. is truly trans there is a remote possibility that the family could face some bigotry, but it is absurdly unlikely. As many posters have pointed out, small children visit the bathroom of the parent who accompanies them, and no one objects to that.<br/><br/>The lack of clarity in the letter and its not-so-subtle self-congratulatory tone, lead one to believe that the parents are not really concerned about the family trip at all. Their letter is a virtue signifier; its purpose is to show NYTimes readers how exquisitely sensitive and progressive these people are.",

I stopped eating \"red meat\" about 40yrs ago, was a vegetarian for many yrs., Occasionally, I eat good quality chicken and non farmed fish.  When my left knee was intermittently inflamed for several yrs., I discovered that it was the dairy that was the cause (Thank you CHINA STUDY).  Eating more legumes  protein &amp; low in calories. In case you are thinking that my diet is boring and perhaps tasteless, here are just a few of my favorite ingredients: lots of garlic, olive oil, fresh herbs (favs..cilantro, parsley, rosemary, sage) fresh lemon/limes (zest and juice),red pepper flakes, pinoli nuts.  Buy your dried herbs from the health food store (much less expensive) and write the date on the glass bottle.  Buy fresh after yr even if you have a lot left. I like Indian, Thai and Japanese food as well so have their staples on my kitchen as well.  Buy Organic Shoyu instead of soy sauce.  Buy organic, do not use a microwave or teflon pans.  Avoid plastics, store all food &amp; leftovers in glass containers as much as possible  \"Just eat \" even at work ...no iPhone.. or computer,  be grateful for what you are eating. Bring your lunch to work.  Eat out less and use the money you saved from a few meals to buy the best ingredients and all those glass containers. Try this: Shred fresh zucchini. add lemon zest and juice &amp; toasted pine nuts.Takes 5 min!",

				"commentBody": "Every year, after passionate statements by Members of Congress to the effect we must do something about the damage illegal immigration does to the American job market, legislation emerges purporting to do just that. But if you read such legislation it rarely addresses illegal immigration in any productive fashion. Instead it is a Christmas tree of H-1B allocations, exemptions, and opportunities pushed by corporations and recruiters. And every year we hear progress has been made dealing with immigration headaches (meaning there are more H-1B visas, less monitoring, and further flexibility). This has become a clear sham enabling Congress to announce it is open to business for fundraisers and corporate support. Rebuking Disney or Tata accomplishes nothing. Instead of sending Immigration agents to chase would-be gardeners or dishwashers through the desert they should be going through company records H-1B visa by H-1B visa verifying they were issued and are used according to regulations. And when they are not the heads of those firms, whether an American employer or a foreign recruiter, should be in court facing charges of fraud. Jailing a farmworker does little to resolve the leakage of American jobs; jailing the heads of personnel departments or vice-presidents for human resources would have a wonderful effect. Barack Obama is known as the \"deportation President\" for pursuing Central Americans fleeing violence while he coddles executives scamming the US through H-1B visa abuse.",
