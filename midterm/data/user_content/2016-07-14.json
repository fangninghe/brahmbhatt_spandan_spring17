				"commentBody": "I was born in Mexico, and my family overstayed a visitor's visa and immigrated to the US when I was 8. My brother and I both worked hard in (public) school, sacrificing sleep, family time, and \"fun\" to get the grades, activities, and test scores to be accepted to Ivy League schools.  We've just graduated, but professionally, we're doing well and are already thinking about advanced degrees.<br/><br/>What on earth makes working class whites think that they can get good jobs in this American economy without college degrees? Has no one given them good advice in their lives? Do they think they can just coast on their good looks and family ties all their lives? Yeah, some people can do that--the Trumps for example. But everyone else either has to get an education to set them apart or work their butts off in service economy jobs all their lives in order to earn a living. Do working class whites not know this?",

I worked hard and did very well in public schools and I never dreamed of even applying to an Ivy because my family couldn't afford it. There weren't many scholarships available to someone like me: white, with parents above the poverty level but nowhere near upper middle class. I was given the \"good advice\" to not take $100K in student loans, and luckily, went to a state school for almost nothing because of my test scores.<br/><br/>Much of the resentment among blue collar whites stems from the notion that their lives have been blessed by some all-encompassing privilege, particularly economically. The privilege of seeing your race represented on TV is little comfort to the white roughnecks and truck drivers and waitresses who've worked hard and never had much of anything handed to them. They don't expect office jobs and high salaries. But they're tired of being vilified for living.",

							"commentBody": "\"Make America Great Again\" no more means \"Make American White Again\" than Obama's \"Hope and Change\" meant \"Hope and Change to Black\".<br/><br/>This is a tremendous misreading of Trump's words.  Trump's \"greatness\" means productive and, most importantly, competitive.  How many Americans are no longer working, have given up searching for jobs and aren't included in that rosy unemployment number?  How many are facing the end of careers at any time?  He's talking to those Americans.<br/><br/>These Americans have been sidelined in the global economy.    They want to be participants, to be working and competing with other countries.  They want to be in the game, not watching from the sidelines.<br/><br/>There is not one presidential candidate who is speaking directly to them and promising to focus on their cause.  Obama and Hillary are globalists.  Sanders could just as easily destroy businesses as pursue workers' rights.<br/><br/>Trump is like a union leader, but one who understands business, who is looking out for his workers.  That is the primary reason people support him.  It's not for all the other silly reasons being projected. Throwing charges of \"racism\", \"sexism\", \"bias\", etc., are what people do when they face an opposing viewpoint with popular support.  The more support, the crazier these accusations get.",
