				"commentBody": "It is far overdue for the FDA to streamline the ANDA (abbreviated new drug application) process to approve generic versions of drugs near their patent expiration dates.  The EpiPen approval relies on the novel injector, not the drug itself, so critical delivery devices need to be included in such an initiative.  But like the Turing anti-toxoplasmosis drug Daraprim, the chemicals themselves are actually very cheap and very easy to make, but it costs too much to maintain licensed manufacturing capability under FDA inspection if your sales are too small.  If a generic drug has a single approved source, creating a US monopoly, the FDA should apply compulsory licensing to enable a second manufacturer to utilize the existing ANDA registration package for free, and create a real market.  For some of these old but vital drugs, with few patients, the costs to manufacture, formulate and sell could even be subsidized by charitable foundations (Gates, Clinton, Buffet) already involved in similar low-cost drug access programs outside the US.  Americans pay essentially 100% of the cost for the new drug innovation.  Maybe it's time we got a subsidized drug benefit for life-saving drugs, too?",

You have prepared a new pasta that says \"Wheat free\" and to be safe, you have the same meal for the other two children. Shortly after beginning the meal, you notice that your youngest son has gone quiet: \"Mom, there's something wrong with these noodles.\" His eyes become immediately bloodshot, his face and neck is covered in hives, and he begins wheezing, struggling for breath, and tearing at his throat (because it is closing up). You drag the children to the car; while your husband drives at breakneck speed to the hospital, you inject him with an Epi-pen because he is not doing well. there may be some projectile vomiting involved. This is very scary but your allergist said you have to do this.  When you get to the ER, Heather, don't worry, when you scream       \" He's having an anaphylactic reaction \"you go to the head of the class because your child is dying in front of you.  Your child may receive another life saving dose of epinephrine, as well as IV steroids, benadryl, pepcid, etc. and probably be held overnight because a second rebound reaction can occur. Thank you so much for this life saving medication. Now what are you going to do? ",

(Well, typically corporate executives exercise that duty without ignoring their \"duty to themselves\" to acquire a pretty good chunk of change for themselves.)<br/><br/>2)There are mechanisms that sharply favor people to rise to the top in both corporate management and politics if they are a little \"sociopathic\"   (i.e., minimally guilty about harming others and willing to freely distort the truth --Bernie Madoff being an apparent full sociopath).<br/><br/>Thus, free of a psychological force suppressing distortion of truth, Mylan executives make attempts to explain Mylan's behavior without pointing out that it is just doing its duty to the shareholders, and not pointing out that to change its behavior, you really would need price regulation, like just about everywhere else in the world.  (I.e.,, pointing out that you would need price regulation would violate the fiduciary duty to the shareholders, and probably wouldn't be so hot for the executives \"duty to themselves\"-wise.)<br/><br/>3)Given the \"sociapathic\" selection factor for people at the top in politics, perhaps especially strong in the U.S., the rules on pharmaceutical pricing (and causing other pathologies in our medical system) aren't going to be fixed anytime soon.<br/><br/>He who is surprised is not wise.",
