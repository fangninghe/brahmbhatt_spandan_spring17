				"commentBody": "A \"strident\" atheist is one who says out loud that they don't believe in god. It's been my experience that stridency is much more prevalent among believers, including many priests, but only atheists get smeared with \u201cstrident.\u201d<br/><br/>It is a false equivalency to say that certainty of a god is on a par with not believing in a god. If there is to be a contest, the onus is on believers to prove the insupportable things they are certain of. Typically, an atheist concedes that they will believe once someone produces evidence. Conversely, it is typical of believers that no amount of evidence contradicting their religion\u2019s tenets could change their minds. Ben Carson, a physician(!), believes the earth is 5,000 years old. There is no equivalent absurdity among atheists. Religion carries on despite conflicting evidence. It is religion that needs repair, not atheism.<br/><br/>If believers want peace and comity with people who beliefs diverge from theirs, they ought to stop trying to impose their beliefs on others. But if they persist, they will get serious stridency in response. I am under no obligation\u2014ethically, morally, or legally\u2014to embrace anybody else\u2019s beliefs, or to make concessions to them. ",

				"commentBody": "As an atheist, I really hate this essay.  Don't tell me what I believe, and don't tell me that you know I have doubts about my atheism.  I don't.  I give the existence of some kind of God as much credence as Russel's orbiting export (or its latest incarnation, the FSM). As another commenter astutely said, claims advanced without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.  The burden is on the believers to provide evidence for their ridiculous ideas.  <br/><br/>There is no equivalence between making fantastic claims without evidence, and asking for evidence before believing the aforementioned fantastic claims.",

				"commentBody": "Actually, your sarcasm serves to make Donald Trump's points exactly.  Americans have been told for decades that free trade would ultimately lift the U.S. economy.  I am not a fan of Trump at all and, his reactionary tactics are absurd.  However, the trade surpluses you cite are miniscle relative the the deficits with other countries while our overall collective deficit is unsustainable and can't be wished away to \"greatness\".  You are ignoring the magnitude of the problem.<br/><br/>As the economic donut gets larger, so does its hole.  And, into this hole we pour tremendous amounts of  revenue (much of it borrowed) to pay for the \"too good to be true\" prices of cheap imported goods.  Those hidden costs are reflected in crime, subsidies and social programs for the un/underemployed, welfare, food stamps, and community blight and my taxes, at least, are staggering. <br/><br/>The American people do not feel we have gotten a fair deal from free trade and despite some data to the contrary, the trendline outlook is not good.   Yes, Donald is wrong and yes, not every one here is an economist but, your summary dismissal of their concerns is why Mr. Trump is doing as well as he is.  I have not seen many comments suggesting simple solutions or, trade isolationism. For those who are  un/underemployed, it is undeniable that we do need \"a better deal\" because the scorecard (reflected in our debt and deficit) says we are losing.",

				"commentBody": "The one word I'll contend that Connie missed was \"good\" (jobs). Yes, there are lots of minimum wage jobs out there, not so many of the old middle-class manufacturing jobs.<br/><br/>That said, I'm not totally convinced (thanks in part to Irwin's article) that the problem is simply the trade deficit. Perhaps a more accurate contention is that the gains from the trade deficit (and automation) have mostly gone to the 1%.<br/><br/>There are gains from trade deficits (e.g. low interest rates, as the article pointed out). The problem, it strikes me, is that we wasted half that money on the 2000's building/refinance boom, and the other half has gone straight to the top (in terms of e.g. a higher stock market). Think of if instead we had invested that money in say infrastructure and research. We all might have been a lot better off. But heaven forbid that the Republicans let that happen.<br/><br/>I'm not sure, but it's at least an interesting contention.",

It depends on which force is more economically powerful: fewer jobs creating exports or investment dollars flowing into the country.\"<br/>I believe it was Studs Terkel who said that he preferred to give money directly to beggars (regardless of how they might use it), rather than give it to charities.  This way he could be sure that 100% of his donation would reach its target.  Using financial repercussions from outsourcing to bring jobs back seems like a Rube Goldberg to me.  And what's to keep newly created jobs from going the same route?  What's the point of learning a transient profession anyway?  It's very inefficient - and social assistance alternatives are costly to the state and to the psychology of the recipient.    ",

You confuse yourself when you refer to Paganism pre-existing Christianity. Yes, there are and were non-Christian religions that came before Christianity. But, when you refer to them as pagan you are implicitly calling them non-Christian, regardless of where they fit in history. It's kind of like calling a people non-white. It only has meaning if there are white people. If there were no whites you'd just call them... People.",

Religious people don't need to unhand our democracy considering religious people gave us our democracy and warned us it couldn't be maintained without a religiously based moral code. They even based the existence of our most basic rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness on the self evidence and gifting of a creator. Without this religious assumption, from where do you suppose our unalienable rights come? And if they are not mandated by a creator existing above us and our government, do governments have the responsibility to secure them if a majority or controlling, violent minority chose not to recognize those rights. And if that becomes the situation would that be moral, since a truly atheistic society has no moral standard other than the prevailing majority?  In an atheistic society there are no true minority rights... Unless the majority recognizes them because there is no standard above the majority to whom a member of the minority can appeal. One can reason and debate, but without a higher creator and morality giver, there is nothing to claim the majority is wrong if they refuse to recognize your right. But that is the real appeal of atheism, the moral superiority of placing yourself as the sole moral standard. If I must choose you or God as the standard of proof of my unalienable rights I, like the religious founding fathers, choose God.",

It was a religious people who signed the document that gave us the religious statement that we are all equal and possess unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness because we are created that way and our creator gifts us with those rights. These predominantly religious people then proceeded to establish our democratic republic to secure these rights. Throughout our history various minorities have pointed to these truths as proof and defense of their rights. <br/><br/>Define for me where minority rights come from in an atheistic society. If there is no moral standard above us or our government, how can any right exist without the acceptance of the majority or a dictatorial minority? And if there is no moral standard above us or the government is it wrong for the majority to deny a minority these rights?  In the absence of a creator , from where does my or your unalienable right to life or Liberty come?  And if it is simply us that grant them, can't we just as morally take them away?  And if that is the case are they unalienable?",
