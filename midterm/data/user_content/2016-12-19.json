We opened a '61 Chambolle-Musigny-Charmes that my dad bought for $6.  It was a delicious pinot with wonderful acidity, still wonderful and definitely in large part enjoyed as a fitting toast to the dear departed and as a nod to the next generation.",

				"commentBody": "Amazing. I've dipped my toes into the construction waters (one in NYT, hopefully more someday), and this puzzle feels nothing short of wizardry to me.  I once tried to get 1-across and the last across clue to have matching clues in a puzzle I was making, just for a cute semi-related bonus-effect to the theme... couldn't do it without ruining those corners.  That was ONE clue I was trying to match!  In a 15x15, not a darn Sunday, for goodness sake!  This is wizardry. Nothing short of it, Mr. Niederman.  Incredibly well done, thank you.  I also really love the thought that every single of solver had to first fill in a down clue unless they were guessing, because, by definition, every single across answer could be more than one thing!

				"commentBody": "Montreal, I agree with you. You are spot on.<br/><br/>What we need is conserve and produce less, enough for a comfortable life. A 1,200 or sq.ft. space for up to 3 people, with 1&amp;1/2 baths, enough heating in winter and some cooling in summer, mostly with attic fan with minimal use of AC. A TV &amp; wifi connection and 1 or 2 computers and cell-phones. If well-connected mass transit is made available a car is unnecessary. With bicycles we can get by.<br/><br/>We need good libraries to expand our knowledge. Private art collections are too much of a luxury. We should have access to art galleries &amp; museums. More social gatherings and leisure time activities, which are hardly expensive, ought to be encouraged.<br/><br/>Produce a lot less &amp; consume a lot less. Per capita waste should be minimal-to-negligible. Simple living ought to become fashionable.<br/><br/>All-in-all, Bernie Sanders's democratic socialism is a good model. But his policies are US-centric, against NFTA &amp; TPP. Both would lead to, I THINK a lot less misery to tens of millions of poor people.<br/><br/>However, I am not for increase in trade volume. Strictly speaking, trade should be minimal. As far as possible a country or region should produce most it needs locally &amp; import only things they can't produce locally, in the long run.",

				"commentBody": "While green technology might help to alleviate man-made pollution a bit, the key word is still \"Man-Made\" - overpopulation burdened the earth and stretch nature's ability to heal itself from abuse. China had been exemplary in controlling population explosion with the one-child policy. They must stay on the program. Too bad other countries did nothing significant to curb population growth. Recently Canada's newly elected government brings more middle-east refugees into Canada after much calculation and politically correctness. A TV team revisited a typical refugee family one year after their arrival. The couple brought with them four young kids. Neither parents could find job yet, they can't speak English. are employed yet. The wife is now pregnant with the fifth kid. Unfortunately some culture will not do anything to help bring population growth down due to religious or traditional values. It is worrisome problem for the whole world.",

				"commentBody": "Manufacturing output in this country has increased considerably over the last 20 years as manufacturing jobs have decreased.  Automation is, of course, the reason.  This is one of the major issues of our time, as the trend of depending on automation (meaning robotics) will continue in exponential fashion, unabated.<br/><br/>This is the conversation we need to be having in this country, not how to bring back all those jobs.  I suspect Trump knows this, meaning he scammed at lot of people during the race.  Even Carrier's CEO has stated that to remain competitive, a lot of the \"saved\" jobs will eventually be lost to automation. <br/><br/>It doesn't look like those people who have lost those jobs will even be able to get jobs in the fast food industry for much longer if the new Secretary of Labor has his way.  I don't begin to have the answers to this very serious issue, but it does seem that greatly improving access to good education without the prospect of drowning in student debt has to be part of the solution.",

				"commentBody": "The strategy of the Taiwanese military revolves around the assumption that the United States will help Taiwan if a Chinese invasion were to occur. However, this assumption has led doubts in the 21st century. One of the few reasons why the U.S. might want to help Taiwan is through the pressures of South Korea and Japan. Taiwan stands on a strategic location in the Pacific and any expansion by China (as seen with the Senkaku Island disputes) will send alarm bell ringing in South Korea and Japan.<br/><br/>In essence, there is nothing we can do if the United States refuse to intervene militarily.

China was an ally in WWII and as such was given a seat in the UN Security Council but by 1971 the strangeness of the arrangement being held by a small island was enough for the Peoples Republic of China to be given that seat by the UN and Nixon\u2019s visit, an avid anti-communist, in 1972 sealed the one China deal for the world, or most of it.<br/> Taiwan, in the various forms it took as dictatorship evolving into an elective democracy, has lived with that arrangement but not gleefully.<br/>It wishes a large role but even Tsai Ing-wen has been careful not to raise the issue of Independence. Wise diplomacy will let that issue evolve historically but America under Trump could do otherwise and the costs will not be minimal; speculation unsless. ",
