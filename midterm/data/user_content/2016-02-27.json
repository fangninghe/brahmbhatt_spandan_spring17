				"commentBody": "While I consider some of Gates analysis and solutions regarding energy, health, and education questionable, he seems head and shoulders above the Facebook, Google, and other billionaires who appear to lack the humility that is necessary for those with great power to effect positive change rather than do damage, even if the damage is just from unintended consequences.<br/><br/>As to energy, while Gates acknowledge full-cycle costs as pertinent to the consideration of biofuels, such an approach is needed across the board. For example: what is the true full-cycle environmental cost of buying a new car that gets 3 m.p.g. better gas mileage than the one it is replacing? One must factor in the pollution of all sorts that comes from extracting the raw materials, processing them, transporting those products to a vehicle assembly facility, and the creation of the vehicle itself. In addition, one must add the environmental costs of disposing of the old vehicle.<br/><br/>Should one keep a '72 that gets 14 m.p.g. or buy a new one that gets 17, 25, or 30 m.p.g.? Even if you should dump it now in favor of a 2016 car that gets 33 m.p.g., does that mean you should or should not have dumped it in 1980 for 17 m.p.g., in 1990 for a 23 m.p.g., or 2000 or a 28 m.p.g. car?<br/><br/>So far, the research has not been done to answer these questions. Without knowing the full-cycle story across the board, we are left potentially making feel-good decisions on no sound basis and with questionably beneficial effects.",

							"commentBody": "Thought I'd reply to this at the risk of being repetitive.  <br/><br/>The full-cycle carbon emissions cost of a particular product or technology could be a topic for research to address.  But consider that a price on fossil-derived carbon would in effect do the research for you.  <br/><br/>By attaching a cost to fossil fuels, in proportion to the amount of CO2 they release when combusted, the suppliers of fossil fuels and of goods which are fossil fuel intensive to produce will have to incorporate the increased cost into their products, if they want to stay in business.  No economic research is needed since the full-cycle environmental costs would be incorporated into pricing.  That would steer small and large decisions of what to buy and where to invest.    <br/><br/>As a policy prescription, this is about as good as it gets - it steers the economy into more sustainable technologies in a way which naturally incorporates the full-cycle climate (CO2) impacts which your post raises. Given the risks which increasing atmospheric CO2 poses to the climate of the only planet we have, it's critical that we reward the best technologies for the long run by adopting some form of pricing of fossil carbon.  The policy proposed by Citizens' Climate Lobby, called Carbon Fee &amp; Dividend, does this while preserving a robust economy and protecting low income Americans.

I also think that BECS and negative anthropogenic CO2 fluxes are ridiculous false hopes unless/until the world population is much lower than today's ... the loss of food production they require cannot be afforded.<br/><br/>Nothing that Bill Gate's big-idea funding (like magical mini-nukes etc) can be ready to roll in less than 20 years ... and then there's the build out.<br/><br/>We need to run with wind and solar, because it is in fact economic right now and it IS SCALING, scaling really great in fact.   If 'magic\" happens, then great .. but there's a issue that as wind and solar scale they get cheaper and cheaper ... very reasonable forecasts put the LCOE of wind below 3 c/KWH (from favorable sites) SOON, with solar below 4 c/KWH ditto.    <br/><br/>The same problem that the renewables had for so many years, how to gain entry and scale to be competitive against an entrenched technology that was cheaper, will then apply to the new technology.  Being \"no CO2\" won't be a reason to subsidize it through its scaling transition ... it will need to bring that AND some other big advantage.<br/><br/>I wouldn't waste a nickel on next-gen nukes for grid electric power -- never going to catch renewables.  I think the idea of ship-propulsion from mini-nukes might be a winner in a CO2-constrained world though.<br/><br/>And then money spent on improved batteries (or reversible energy storage technologies generally) and transmission: no brainers.",

Already being done in many areas, is mandated by code for HVAC in large buildings in some more progressive urban areas, to shift/shave the peak loads that air-conditioning demands generate.<br/><br/>In the US, peak power loads are UNIVERSALLY driven by air-conditioning (not food refrigeration!) in heat-waves.  Solar power correlates very well but there is the \"duck-curve\" problem: the air-conditioning demand lingers on into the evening.  <br/><br/>Coolth-storage fixes that.  It also allows excess night-time capacity (from wind e.g.) to deliver the next day's AC.<br/><br/>Also just mentioning it ... look at the distribution of wind turbines in Texas: the really good wind resource is out in west texas ... lots of turbines out there and more going in.   But there are a swath of turbines along the coast from Corpus Cristi down to Browsville ... why is that?  It's not as good wind-resource as west texas.  <br/><br/>It's because in heat-waves the sea-breeze circulation turns on strongly -- these wind-turbines correlate beautifully with peak demand .. .they are effectively renewable 'peaker plants' selling the electricity they generate in the high-price market at that time.

Or present us the peer-reviewed analysis and code for the UAH team as they continue to stagger through endless beta versions of their 6th attempt to get their stuff right.<br/><br/>Sea level - every tide gauge station has land motion elements, global sea level rise elements, and local ocean trend elements. But here's a recent study that sheds some light on why the sea levels are currently rising when global temperatures peaked 6000 years ago and HAD BEEN declining since then.<br/><br/>\"Temperature-driven global sea-level variability in the Common Era\"<br/><br/>\"We present the first, to our knowledge, estimate of global sea-level (GSL) change over the last \u223c3,000 years that is based upon statistical synthesis of a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions. GSL varied by \u223c\u00b18 cm over the pre-Industrial Common Era, with a notable decline over 1000\u20131400 CE coinciding with \u223c0.2 \u00b0C of global cooling. The 20th century rise was extremely likely faster than during any of the 27 previous centuries.\"<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/17/1517056113\" title=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/17/1517056113\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/17/1517056113</a><br/><br/>And you continue to err with \"pause\".  Warming at the surface was at a slower rate, but continued.  Oceans continued unabated warming during the same period.  So the rate of warming at the surface slowed for a bit. Natural cycles are part of the climate still. Heat was going into ocean depths. But greenhouse warming trends move cycle endpoints up.",
