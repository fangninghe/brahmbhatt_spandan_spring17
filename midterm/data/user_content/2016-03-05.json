				"commentBody": "Yet another article in which a small amount of light shineth of the awfulness of revenue generating sports at the collegiate level. <br/><br/>Here's the deal:<br/><br/>It is absurd to believe that any top 20-30 basketball recruit in the country would chose a school that exists in a minor conference and has a terrible history of producing NBA draft picks. If you can play, and you choose SMU, the public can be assured that someone (Aunt, Uncle, AAU coach, sister, brother, mom, dad, 6th removed Uncle) is getting paid. You also don't go to any West Coast school if you're any good - it should be an immediate yellow flag to any college basketball follower. <br/><br/>It is absurd to believe that it's not a sellers market - there's only so much talent out there. If you're a good player - a player that can have an immediate impact on program - you will be given whatever you want. It's just a question of what you want and how clean the transaction can be.<br/><br/>In the case of SMU, they danced with the devil and they're now facing the consequences - however, I can assure you there will be those within the SMU community who will believe they still came out on top. <br/><br/>So, when you read a top 10 kid \"takes his talent\" to a certain school, know that talent comes at a price for all.

				"commentBody": "But, yes it is about education.  Why shouldn't these kids--whether they initially finish  college or not--be required to have the most basic of academic skills? Go straight from high school to some kind of minor league, like baseball has, but know how to read well, write, do math and understand the scientific method and your society's history.  Is that too much to demand?  <br/><br/>We do not know Frazier's true academic capabilities because no one forced him to develop them.  Even his mother seemed satisfied with the status quo.  His story reminds me of the many stories in urban America.  Kids will never get anywhere until they at least GO TO SCHOOL.  And who else is better able to enforce that dictum than the kid's parents, relatives and clergy.  The NCAA and its feeder schools have a lot to answer for but the kids, parents and school staff themselves know that what they are doing is wrong.  Blame everyone involved not just the coaches.  ",

				"commentBody": "Please...yes, the educational system is at fault if it was complicit in his academic failure.  But his mom, his academically bottom-feeding school and Frazier himself bear some responsibility.  He didn't know he should go to school? Study?  A,student of any race knows that.  A parent of any race knows that. My parents did not go to college. My grandparents had no high school diploma.  My father was no academic star.  But my grands and parents knew I was supposed to go to school and would have punished me if I cut.  My father may not have been able to help with homework but he knew I should do it and made sure I did.<br/><br/>Frazier's mom is not so naive not to know he should have been going to school.  She lied about her rent to put sports above academics. I have great empathy for kids who grow up in an environment that does not value academics.  They have it harder than affluent kids.  But they know right and wrong regarding school.  They have teachers willing to put in extra hours to help them succeed.  <br/><br/>My kid was no academic star, either.   He went to school in the worst-performing school system in the state.  But he had math and science teachers who tutored before and after school. I forced him to go. I encouraged the best preparation for any life endeavor:  READ, READ, READ  Public libraries are free. Couldn't Frazier's mom and he, himself, have used them? Lots of complicity here. Blaming only racism is itself racism that sells kids short without forcing them to try. ",

But they should be encouraged, forced if necessary,  to perform academically well before college.  Yes, colleges capitalize on athletes but that capitalizing goes back way before college and includes way more than just coaches.  How many potential doctors, lawyers, teachers,cops end up on the trash heap because no one demanded they study and they did not demand that of themselves? Who knows what Frazier can accomplish?  And I don't just mean hoops, here.  And, you know what, it is not too late.  It will take a lot of work but he may not only be a great ball player but a potential teacher of other ball players, too.",
