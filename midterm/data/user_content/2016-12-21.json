I think there are \"secular Muslims\" and \"secular Christians\".<br/><br/>As an example, Turkey is a secular country even though 97% of its citizens are Muslims. According to research by the Pew Center, 88% of Turks do not want to live under sharia law. See <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/22/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/\" title=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/22/muslims-and-islam-key-findings-in-the-u-s-and-around-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/07/22/muslims-and-islam-key-fi...</a><br/><br/>Similarly, \"secular Christians\" in the US support freedom of religion (which would be denied were we to make Christianity a state religion and base our laws on the Bible).<br/><br/>I am grateful to have been born in a secular country. I think the separation of church and state is an essential part of justice for all.  I wish we could replace the tide of religious war with a wave of secularism that increased tolerance and let the peoples of the world focus on common goals and improving everyone's lives. How sad that we are still fighting about religion in the 21st century.",
