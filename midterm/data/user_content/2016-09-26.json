This term, I decided to give students a little profile to fill out and hand in, in addition to the usual verbal introductions. I included a question about pronouns, and received some preferences for \"they\" from some of the most cis-gender-appearing students I've ever seen--it was eye-opening, even for a gender-studies-phile like me! The question of gender is being more widely and deeply explored among the entire breadth of the college-age generation, more than you might think.",

							"commentBody": "Having taught for many years in a community college, in a program culminating in RN licensure,  I am  less interested in students' gender expression (or class, racial or cultural identity) than I am in their showing up on time for class, reading assigned material, and participating in discussions.  Professional /vocational programs in healthcare are more about learning to focus on others and work collaboratively than about self-expression. In this discipline, classroom dialogue that emphasizes identity is a distraction, except if a student speaks from their gender/class/race to flesh out health disparities or population/ community health discussions.  Theater, art or gender studies programs are the ideal platform to express one's personal identity; it would seem silly to address one's  gender identity  in a chemistry class, for example,  it's just not germane.",

That by itself should tell you that they are not equivalent. I could mention Trump's four bankruptcies and three trophy wives. His casual use of slander and bigotry; his level of narcissism which by itself should disqualify him for public office, or that he seems to believe everything he says is true even when he said the opposite just yesterday. Basically any one who claims their baggage is even remotely equivalent would have a very hard time trying to rationalize their position using facts.   ",

Any abuse of its power may be argued to be tyranny.<br/><br/>A pattern of systematic abuse of power by representatives of the state is quite a serious problem don't you think ?<br/><br/>But mostly, it is a subject, when the repetition of acts statistically show an institutional problem, where actions can be taken by the government to limit and correct this pattern.<br/><br/>The government can intervene to reduce these problem by better organizing, training, choosing, police force.<br/><br/>That does not make the subject of black on black violence irrelevant for example. But solving this other, eventually linked issue, asks for a solution that is broader than ensuring police forces do not show a pattern of  potentially racist behavior through statistics.<br/><br/>Finally, you brandish as proof of your conclusions a part of the problem : the impunity of the police until now, when widespread personal videos contribute to establish a pattern that was before hidden through the systematic primacy of the police officers testimony about the situation they faced.",
