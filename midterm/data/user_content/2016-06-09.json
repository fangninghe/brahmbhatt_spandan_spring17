Mrs. Clinton has a lot of work to do and she's going to need every vote she can get. She needs to help Americans know and understand her better self and she'd do well to strip her environment of those who reduce her candidacy to a historical achievement for femalekind. To me, that IS the best part of her candidacy; that's the problem.",

It's intersting that the former Illegal who the show-runners rely on for insight into Philip has said that he loved his cover job ( working for an insurance company) so much ( the comraderie, the intellectual challenge, the excellent benefits) that it converted him to capatalism. This and other insight can be found in the outstanding Slate Podcast ( very insider since the Joel Weisbergs brother is on Slates board ). Don't miss it or you'll think incorrectly that the con pulled on Young Hees husband is unrealistic ( in fact that scenario was used repeatedly by Soviet agents) or that Philip,and Elizabeth are supposed to be psychopaths ( no no no...soldiers doing their jobs)",

Also strikes me that - in the same way many of the attacks on Obama were racially tinged, the relentless attacks on her have the whiff of misogyny.

Absolutely nothing. She has weathered it all, better than any public figure I know. And that she has done so as a woman in a deeply misogynist world is simply remarkable. Is she cautious? Is she centrist? Of course she is those things. If she were not cautious, or centrist, what would she be (called)? You know it: shrill, brazen, feminazi, etc etc. (which, come to think of it, she's been called anyway). She'll never please everybody, and she's smart enough to know that. So she absorbs these attacks and moves on. That's grit. That's smart.<br/><br/>So it's sad, still, to see people here -- even Dems -- attacking her still, using right-wing inspired talking points pedaled by FOX news and radio shock jocks. And let's not fool ourselves: the veneer of politesse is the thinnest facade hiding the distemper of those who simply cannot stand the idea that there are smart, talented women.

The only thing keeping it under control is developers cutting it back to build housing developments.<br/>Add in Bamboo. It was brought in to suck up the water in the marshes.

Brought into South Florida where I grew up to stop the erosion of the banks along waterways and canals. Now it clogs them up and has to be removed mechanically.

				"commentBody": "In West Africa, where the original Brer Rabbit stories originated, there is a wonderful legend of how the mosquito saved mankind. In the story, man was getting too big for his boots and the animals got together and asked God whether she could somehow constrain or eliminate the problem. The word went out that if 3 species would vouch for man in 2 weeks, he would be spared. Of course, dog immediately came forth and said that man fed and nurtured him. A week later, horse came and said that man looked after him. Time passed, and no other creature came forth until finally, within hours of the deadline, mosquito came forth \u2026 and that is how mosquito saved humanity. The story always makes me laugh if only for testimony of the very human ability to make the best of a bad situation.<br/>Having said, are we not also like a virus spreading without limit, consuming all earth\u2019s resources recklessly without constraint? Maybe the animals who requested the initial divine intervention had a point, but perhaps more ominously, this technology could eventually be used against a humanity that refuses to acknowledge its own overpopulated destiny.
