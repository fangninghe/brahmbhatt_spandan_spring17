							"commentBody": "Within a year of the U.S. entering WW2, Roosevelt established a new US Army division (roughly 10,000 - 15,000 men) composed entirely of people with knowledge and experience at building and developing infrastructure. People like engineers, architects, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, road builders, etc. They spent almost four years preparing for the day they'd go to Germany, and other nations, to rebuild what was destroyed by war.<br/>At no time, did anyone have to answer questions about their loyalty to a political party, to Roosevelt personally, or on subjects having nothing to do with their jobs (like abortion).<br/><br/>Fast forward to 2003. We conquered Iraq, and now had to rebuild it. But according to a multitude of books looking into it, turns out the people put in charge of putting together the rebuilding staffers all came from places like the Federalist Society, the Cato Institute and other rightwing thinktanks. And the first questions they asked anyone seeking to help rebuild Iraq had nothing to do with skills or training. No, they asked questions about whether or not you felt personal loyalty to President Bush; did you believe that only a totally unregulated free-market economy could work; your views on abortion, etc.<br/><br/>Turned out, the people chosen to rebuild Iraq almost never had the basic skills necessary to do the job, but were instead political apparatchiks chosen for their GOP loyalty and their ideological purity. No wonder Iraq collapsed as it did...",

I am thrilled that she is running for President, not only because of the prospect of having a woman in the Oval Office -- although that is a big part of it for me -- but mostly because she is the most qualified of any of the candidates running on either Party ticket.  As for Bernie, in my view he is a delusional wingnut who is not close enough to Hillary in experience, savvy, strength, knowledge -- especially in the areas of foreign policy, healthcare and reforming the financial industry -- to breathe the same air. <br/><br/>Every woman who has lived long and experienced what women have over the past half century know that it takes women longer than men to climb the ladder. Hillary has made that climb brilliantly. In our deeply troubled times -- in which President Obama has done a remarkable job in leading us out of the catastrophic situation caused by the Bush Administration -- Hillary is the only one with the head on her shoulders to lead the nation so that we can solve our domestic problems while continuing to stand tall on the global stage. And she's the only one who will allow me to sleep at night, without one eye open.   ",

This kind of Policy change is pure inflation. This idea that raising the minimum wage will help, is a deception. That will cause fewer jobs and make it even harder for young people to find a entry level job. ",
