He wanted to conduct a recount in which ballots in which voters had voted for both Bush and Gore, and had been therefore not counted, be reevaluated.  Those ballots that showed a straight D vote should be counted for him.  The ballots were designed by Democrats and used in Democrat precincts.  He also wanted ballots with \"hanging chads\" counted in his favor despite the fact that on a second time around, the mechanical counting devices loosened enough chads that the count became very variable.<br/><br/>A large proportion of Trump supporters are Democrats, who did object to the SCOTUS decision.<br/><br/>And keep in mind that the voters spoke a second time, in 2004, hat they wanted Bush.",

While Roosevelt is an incredibly important person in US History, the magnitude of what Tubman did and the courage she had during the American Civil War is more important than Roosevelt. Tubman was risked her life to do the right thing, continuously. Bottom line. Her contribution is as important as the many Germans and Polish people including Oskar Schindler that went against the Nazi's and hid the Jewish people, knowing full well that if caught they would die the same wretched death as the Jewish. I'm pretty sure you do not object to the bravery of the Europeans but in this case do not think highly of Tubman.  For the record, I learned about her in regular school during the American History class. I'm not sure why you claim 99% do not know her when they essentially wanted her for another bill.",
