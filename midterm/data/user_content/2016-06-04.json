				"commentBody": "You say Clinton had a good day, Gail. I say she had a bad week.<br/><br/>While MSNBC has been supportive of Clinton during this campaign, hosts had harsh criticisms after the inspector general released his report.<br/><br/>Mika Brzezinski: It Feels Like Hillary Clinton Is Lying Straight Out | Morning Joe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJE0U8Qby4\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJE0U8Qby4\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkJE0U8Qby4</a><br/><br/>Clips were shown of Clinton repeatedly saying during the past year that her \u201cpersonal email use was fully above board and allowed by the State Department.\u201d<br/><br/>Andrea Mitchell: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hold up. There are so many inconsistencies, including their response yesterday. We now see new emails, never turned over, that the IG found. What\u2019s that all about? \u2026 She said [to an aide] we want to make sure that the \u2018personal is not accessible.\u2019 There are so many flaws in their argument I don\u2019t see how this is anything but devastating given the fact that they have been making a completely different argument now for more than a year.\u201d<br/><br/>Chuck Todd: \u201cBecause of this breach ... I don\u2019t think she could get confirmed, for instance, to be attorney general. The most logical explanation is that she wanted to make it harder for the press and Congress to see her correspondence. So they made the FOIA requests more difficult by doing what? Making sure it wasn\u2019t on a government server. I\u2019ve never been able to accept that [Clinton had the server for convenience] because what is convenient about putting a server in your house? I hate dealing with Wi-Fi in my house. It\u2019s a pain.\u201d",

I have no great love for Hillary but my dislike of Trump cancels out any animosity I have for her.  I could have liked other Republican candidates, but not enthusiastically. Republicans voted for Trump despite his lack of any experience or policy. Whether you want to face it or not, Clinton is sane and Trump is not.  I liked Bernie until he started on his hate campaign against Clinton and he has no hope of winning the nomination anyway.

I suggest that it\u2019s a shared disdain for the establishment of BOTH sides that have disappointed so many Americans who haven\u2019t seen their life-prospects improve in so long. Without putting too fine a point on it, when you look up the word \u201cestablishment\u201d in your Funk &amp; Wagnalls, you find a picture of Hillary Rodham Clinton. That can\u2019t be good for the architect of Whitewater, even if she DOES edge out Bernie in CA.<br/><br/>Tim spent a fair amount of time on Moonbeam, and I\u2019ve been giving him a lot of ink myself in comments here and there. Given all the talk about the difficulty Bernie is giving Hillary plus the rumors circulating about eMailGate (WHY did the FBI give prosecutorial immunity to the IT guy who set up Hillary\u2019s infamous server?) some are now suggesting that she might not wind up as the Democratic nominee. Well, if the Dems REALLY wanted to toss a wrench into Trump\u2019s juggernaut, it would be with Moonbeam, not Bernie. Regardless of polls, Bernie would lose where with a relatively eMailgate-unscathed Hillary, the outcome would be too close to call until Election Night. But Moonbeam \u2026 is a very formidable avatar of the unchained, potted liberati. He\u2019s actually scary.",

The notion that he's bipartisan is a joke -- he doesn't need to be with a legislature boasting Democratic supermajorities in both houses, bought and paid for by pubic sector unions. His \"political problem-solving\" consists merely of raising taxes.<br/><br/>And, while he earned the name \"Moonbeam\" honestly back in the seventies and early eighties, his focus on your train-from-nowhere revalidates the title yet again in HIS seventies (soon to be HIS eighties).<br/><br/>But I've never underestimated him as a populist force: he's formidable; which is why Dems could do FAR worse than nominating him instead of Hillary.

But there's a big difference between what Hillary did in 2008 and what Bernie Sanders currently says he's going to do. On June 7, 2008, a few days after the primaries ended, Hillary conceded to Barack Obama because he had around 100 more delegates than she did. She gave a generous concession speech and urged her supporters to start supporting Barack. Then she started campaigning for him. At the convention in August 2008, Hillary was the one who nominated Barack for President.  (Google 2008 Democratic primaries\" and you'll find a good Wikipedia article on this.)<br/>Bernie Sanders currently says that even if Hillary Clinton is still ahead of him in popular vote and pledged delegates at the end of the primaries, he is going to contest her nomination at the convention in late July and try to persuade superdelegates to overrule voters' preference for Hillary. For Bernie to do that would be, in my opinion, futile and divisive, and would suck energy and resources away from the all-important goal of defeating Donald Trump in November.  I hope Bernie will change his mind and, if he is still behind Hillary in popular votes and pledged delegates when the primaries are finished, concede graciously to Hillary and throw his support behind her, as she did for Barack in 2008.

If Obama had come out as aggressively for tax reform, cap and trade, immigration reform, public infrastructure, anything at all really since his 2010 mid-term loss of Congress, I think we'd be in a different place. There's a leadership vacuum in Washington, and Trump will fill it if no serious leaders have the guts. Even on gun control, possibly the issue he's sought most directly to address, how has he really educated the public? Katie Couric did more in a single documentary than he has in 7 years... I voted for the man twice, but what a disappointment!! Get out there and fight liberals! Conservatives always fight harder because they're fighting for themselves. Liberals are generally doing good for someone else less well off, and it's shows. They always have to keep their dignified air. Gore, Kerry, Clinton, they're all the same. We need more Warrens and Bernies in the fight.",
