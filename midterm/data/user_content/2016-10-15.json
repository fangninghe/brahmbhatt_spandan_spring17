We live in a very intense world and what kids have to navigate as they grow is more complex than it ever was.<br/>Reading your essay carefully, I sense you are a man with great sensitivity who is uncomfortable with the traditional perceptions of what our culture defines as masculine.  Is it possible you wanted a girl because you are more comfortable with them, and had bad experiences with bullying from boys yourself?  I can assure you, girls can bully, and be bullied, in ways that are emotionally horrific.<br/>Your example at the end has many angles.  It may be my own tendency but what I sensed from reading it is your son exhibited a certain raw energy he couldn't rein in, and which made you uncomfortable.  He aped your language (you handed him an excuse when you said you weren't paying attention to him) to get past a difficult moment.    ",

The costs are so astronomical, unless there is upwards of $80,000 coming in, what do families use for money?  School, doctors, clothes, daycare, transportation, and oh yeah, a house to live in.  No time off, no help, nothing.<br/><br/>We have a tremendous fear in this nation of socialism.  The right takes the position that anything the government does to assist in child rearing somehow robs us of our freedom.  I don't get it.  <br/><br/>Instead we want profits to pay for child rearing services.  But we don't want to tax profits because that's socialism.  We don't want to tax the super rich because that's wealth redistribution which is socialism.  We don't want to raise minimum wages because that will reduce profits which is socialism.<br/><br/>We point to an expanding deficit as an insurmountable problem.  It is insurmountable because we wont reign in healthcare costs, which would reduce profits for the healthcare cabal, which is socialism.  We wont raise Social Security taxes slightly to make it solvent for the rest of the century because that's socialism.  <br/><br/>We give corporations the status of people but we wont tax them because that's socialism.  We give the military anything it wants so we can fight the commie socialists.  <br/><br/>We have socialism on the run, but we forgot about the reason we exist...<br/>the kids.    ",

It has polarized the nation and rendered us incapable of making any decisions.  <br/><br/>In the end, you wouldn't need \"socialism\" if human kindness were innate and universal.  However, simply declaring that it is not so should not be an opportunity to either institutionalize our response OR throw up our hands and insist on freedom.<br/><br/>The funny thing about \"freedom\" is that we use that, too, to achieve disparate ends.  The \"right\" says the freedom allows me to do what I want as I want.  The \"left\" says that freedom allows me to do what I want and it will have no effect on you so stay out of my business.<br/><br/>Again, both ends foster misunderstanding and, occasionally, lies.",

Some did not even own their own home. My parents did, but my mom was raised in a series of apartments. My maternal grandparents could not afford their own home until 1954, and then it was a tiny, tiny bungalow with 2 bedrooms on a tiny lot.<br/><br/>My grandmother worked alright -- in a knitwear sweatshop when she came to the US in 1919. She got married in 1921 and had my mom in 1926. HER mother (my Great Nana) raised my mother from infancy. Common then -- fairly common still now. I have a niece who just had her first baby, and her mother in law has retired specifically to stay home and care for the baby until she is age 5 and in kindergarten.<br/><br/>So people do manage -- then and now. Most of the whinging I notice is NOT from the poor or the working class -- it is from very upper middle class, upper income white professional women, who are furiously angry to find themselves \"stuck\" with childcare and responsibility when they finally decide to have their first baby at 39, after 20 years of \"ambivalence\". They want someone else -- anyone else -- to dump the hard, grotty work of child rearing on!",

				"commentBody": "In India, my mother used to cook pumpkin curry as well as prepare a dessert using pumpkin and sugar. If you mash the pumpkin into a paste,say, like mashed potatoes, and roast it with sugar till it is dry, it makes a delicius, chewy dessert. Even at the age of 70 now, I still savor the taste and crave for it. Last year around Thanksgiving time in the Washington area, I bought a couple of cans of pumpkin and tried to make the dessert. I loved it. <br/><br/>My mother also used to prepare a salty Indian pumpkin curry using onions and tomatoes as the base with the ususal Indian spices - turmeric, corriender, ginger, cumin powder, and garam masala. My wife cooked it for me a couple of times at my request here in Wash. This Thanksgiving I'm going to try both dishes, the curry and the pumpkin dessert. Unfortunately I never watched my mother or wife cook the curry, I have however a good idea about as to how they did it. (Last year my beloved wife passed away. But there are days I prepare one of my wife's favorite diish to think of her more intensely. My preparations never come out as good, but I enjoy the cooking part and the time it takes to do it, as during the cooking my thoughts stay totally fixated on memories of the two most wonderful ladies in my life). I wish everyone has memories to cherish for ever and ever. At moments like those, I truly come to feel my wife's presence in the kitchen smiling and watching me go through my silly, awkward motions. I have come to love cooking. ",

Chicken scratches, yes.  Maybe it's an unfamiliar colloquialism?<br/><br/>And thank you for 'RONDELLE,' a glorious mouthful of a satisfying word, conjuring up lovely images of ridgy light-scattering discs of glass. My mother used to do stained glass and I think I remember learning that in former times, to make panes, molten glass was poured out on a flat stone which was then spun to thin out and flatten the glass into a round sheet.  The rondelle was the center of the disc of glass which cooled before it got all the way flattened out.  This may be magical remembering, but I like the story.  <br/><br/>One thing I love about a stimulating puzzle like this one is how relaxing it is when the answers finally fall into place.

Fat chance.<br/><br/>Yes, when electing a President, I think of who they might appoint and what those appointees may do  Because unlike Hillary, who thought it a great idea to topple Ghaddafi without a plan to fill the void, I consider the consequences of a decision before I act.
