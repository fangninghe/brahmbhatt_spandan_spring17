				"commentBody": "One cannot make a prediction whether the president might serve one or two terms.  We'd have to wait until at least the third year of the first term to make any predictions for the following election.  Lyndon Johnson could not run a second time, as there is a statutory limit of eight years or two terms; Ford was never \"elected,\" as he only served the balance of Nixon's term after Nixon's resignation.  In recent years, I have no doubt that the hostage situation that was the cause for Carter's loss in his bis for a second term may have been instigated by Republican negotiations with an enemy state.<br/><br/>The partisan remarks here are the usual wishful thinking of bloggers trying to oppose others who think differently.

As I recall it was a defoliate that was supposed to be harmless to people but later it was discovered to cause problems in people, too. It really wasn\u2019t as much a weapon as something designed to expose the enemy to firepower.<br/><br/>So many years ago, I wound up going to an emergency room at a hospital in Bethesda where my regular doc did not have privileges. I spent something like ten days in the hospital getting all sorts of tests. I was bleeding and diagnosed with PE, which turned out to be separate problems. But the specialist said 75% of all symptoms are related to the same cause, so they tested me for cancer, everywhere they could think of. Brain scan, CT-Scan, Bone scan and upper and lower GI, in the reverse order that they normally would be. The contraption for the lower GI was medieval in design and operation, twisting me around like a pretzel. The doc who was doing the exam and I weren\u2019t getting along. At one point I saw my appendix (which is still there) was lit up like a floodlight during an air raid and asked her why. She allowed that it was the radioactive residue left over from the upper GI the day before. She then said it was harmless. I replied, \u201cthat\u2019s what they said about Agent Orange.\u201d She didn\u2019t appreciate my retort. We were both glad when it was over. The test showed nothing. ",
