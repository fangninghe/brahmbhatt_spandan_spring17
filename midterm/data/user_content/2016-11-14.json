				"commentBody": "The disconnect between the Democratic candidate and millennials was not a product of distinct political differences, or a debate of the \"lesser of two evils\". The disconnect between Hillary and millennials was one of luxury. The liberal establishment was founded on intellectualism and a concern for voter issues across backgrounds. Liberal voters, when they vote, consider a range of voting issues. This voting behavior is reflected in the media. While the liberal media picked out trivial problems with Clinton's policy, conservative voters stuck to a single issue and disregarded all  of Trump's other problems. <br/><br/>Millennials have the luxury to consider a broad range of voter issues in their own minds when they go to vote, but what does this mean for a larger voter base that might not have the luxury of intellectualism--and relies on single issues of immigration or jobs to make a decision? This election cycle proved that millennials must not only consider and debate voter issues in their own minds, but should make their political considerations public. This would promote enthusiasm among younger voters. Liberal media should change, and the liberal establishment must respond to these changes. It's time for the Democratic party and commentators to make their arguments more accessible to the public, so that their perception isn't handled or channeled by the intellectual elite. The accessibility was most appealing about Bernie's campaign--and he's right to some extent. ",

The abuse includes the manipulation of the systems to deprive young politicians from participating in elections and holding office and the disenfranchisement of a generation of Hong Kongers in violation of an international treaty signed by the PRC.  PRC is China according to the one-party dictatorship of the CCP.  Presently it is one of the many regimes in the tortured history of China.  During the Cultural Revolution in the 1960's and 1970's it emptied out the culture of China.  In the 80's, it killed the best of the country's next generation in Tennamen Square.  It is responsible for the deaths of most Chinese in the history of the world between 1950's and 1960's.  Now it tries to manipulate the electoral and judicial systems in HK in violation of an international agreement.  Otherwise they said they are afraid of a civil war.  They are also paying for tourists and locals in HK to attend their anti-independence rally organized by them.  One thing is sure: this one-party dictatorship needs prayers for all eternity to be saved, and the world with it.  In this year of mercy, let us pray for mercy for the CCP and the PRC.  May the Holy Spirit guide the young politicians of HK and bless and protect them in their service to the HK people as it does for politicians of All Nations. ",

Le Pen's embrace of Trump is a negative for her, as Trump is likely to have an approval rating under 20% among the French.<br/><br/>Sarkozy will not win the right's Presidential primary.  Fillon might but is a long-shot.  So let's settle on Jupp\u00e9 as the likely choice at this moment.  Then it will be Jupp\u00e9 vs Le Pen facing each other in the second-round of the Presidential election.<br/><br/>Jupp\u00e9 is running a socially inclusive campaign with a right-wing economic program.  If he ran a typical campaign - complaining about unemployment and offering ideas how to improve it - he would trounce Le Pen badly, probably 65% to 35%. This is patly because the vast majority of the French prefer Jupp\u00e9's vision of French society to Le Pen's.  It is also because the rest of Le Pen's program is anti-Eu and anti-euro, and the French public is attached to the EU and the euro. <br/><br/>But Jupp\u00e9 is not running the typical campaign.  He has said that he will take his election as a mandate for his program, which includes raising the retirement age to 70, a very unpopular measure.  If Le Pen can transform the election into a referendum on his program, if she can convince the electorate that voting for her is a \"no\" vote on Jupp\u00e9's economic program and not a \"yes\" vote for her own,  then she has a good chance of winning.

As time went on and slavery was no longer feasible, the law and the practice morphed, but without acknowledging a grave sin or atoning for it. America is still racist today. America's elite still takes advantage of those it calls its own. With that as the foundation of my comment, here is the rest... Both campaigns used racial divide and conquer tactics, each no less ugly than the other. The media, instead of just reporting the facts, amplified those tactics and aided and abetted the campaigns, deepening the divisions in ways we can't imagine. As Trump is about to take power, who will start putting the genie back in the bottle? Hillary Clinton focused her campaign on white upper middle class female voters, to the exclusion of everyone else. When police brutality hit in September, she went on a Black radio show to announce she maybe will speak to white people. Did she speak to white people by November 8? Nope!<br/><br/>It isn't Trump's rural America that failed Hillary Clinton, but Hillary Clinton's arrogant expectation that not speaking to lower middle class, blue collar, Black, white, Latino, and Asian millennials wouldn't cost her any votes. Cost, it sure did. Voters don't owe candidates a thing. They didn't owe her in 08 or now.<br/><br/>Whites need to join their Black brothers and sisters in the civil rights struggle.

				"commentBody": "Both countries lived under British rule. Artifacts of a conquered point of view are still present in both countries. Even in simple, petty things, they can be clearly seen, like Americans' raving love of British historical TV, or Indians' exaggeration of British meanness and cursing language in cinema. <br/><br/>Both countries were \"trained\" to fear and value authoritarians.  As country-wide societies, we're still generically susceptible to the shine of glitz, power, money and smack-talking, hard-eyed, bullying individuals. <br/><br/>I've been thinking on this issue for years. How do we turn a ship which has been on a relatively steady course for centuries?  <br/><br/>Revolutionary strategies are only partly effective, it seems, because in using such, we take on some of the attributes of our conquerors. Once supposedly free, some of us then don conquerors' likenesses and mimic their behaviors, even to the point of having episodes of highly-violent civil strife.<br/><br/>It's not democracy itself that's at fault. It's what democracy originally reacted to. It's long shadows cast by past extra-regional authoritarian (and economically devasting) rule. <br/><br/>Only by turning around to again face those old people, by identifying and speaking of the behaviors, values, mass and private communication styles, and education that represent the conquerors' stance in present times, can we move our lives to a healthy, fully-free place.",

				"commentBody": "'Twas the night before Trumpmas, when all through the house, Not a creature was stirring, not even a spouse; Reporters stood close by the chimney with care, In the vain hope that somebody smart would be there; His children were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of Breitbart danced in their heads; When on NBC there arose such a clatter, Billy Bush sprang from his bed to see what was the matter. The Bunnies on the Mara Lago golf-course outside, Made passersby stare and surf at high tide, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But an Access Hollywood Bus, with a microphone to hear! With a little old driver, so lively and quick, Donald said things to make Olympia Snowe sick! His eyes didn't twinkle, his brow wore a frown, His demeanor and gestures were those of a clown. His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, As he began to say more things to blanch Olympia Snowe! He had a broad face and a large fat round belly, That shook just as when he repulsed Megyn Kelly. He was chubby and plump, not a jolly old elf, And I vomited and fainted, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a wave of his hand, Beckoned hooligans everywhere to join his band. And laying his finger aside of his nose, For publicity cameras, struck a soap-opera pose. He got back in the bus, to Arianne Zucker gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, \"I'll buy you a highball at Hooters tonight!\"",

Separatists want an independent Kashmir.<br/><br/>What is wrong with natural resource extraction and foreign capital inflows as bases of prosperity?  They do not contradict productivity gains; resources can be extracted with productive labor, and capital inflows usually buy machines that increase productivity.",

India has more minority population than any other nation on earth and hasn't become a terrible place for them like the article suggests. I am still waiting to hear from New York Times and other such elitist media on how minorities are treated in Muslim majority nations or the Middle east! hmm. Crickets!!!! Demagoguery? New York Times just has to look in the mirror!",
