				"commentBody": "This one seemed to run a little on the hard side for me, particularly because I didn't feel on the constructor's wavelength.  There were two answers I flat-out didn't know, and that's rare for me at this point.  One was LOGROLLS, as a synonym for quid pro quo, and the other was BIG SPOON.  (I certainly know what spooning is, but to me, a BIG SPOON is what you eat soup with--as opposed to stirring your coffee with a little one.)  The clue pointed to the general idea, but I'd never heard the expression.<br/><br/>Now some of you might find these gimmes, and others that I found easy, you might find less so.  So I learned two things tonight.<br/><br/>As for Howard Hughes (the famous one), anyone else put RECLUSE first?<br/><br/>What about FORCE FEEDS for \"Puts away under pressure\"?  True, it's not an exact correspondence, but same number of letters, and it seemed right at the time.<br/><br/>I'm tired of hearing--or thinking--about Julian ASSANGE.  In my book, he's one of the world's biggest 58A.<br/><br/>Anyone put NAIL for GONG?  And then doubt it because it sounded like a drunk reference?<br/><br/>CAVING for DESCENT before seeing that it was too short?  And that a Spanish word wasn't going to end in a V?  CEDE before--wait for it--CAVE?<br/><br/>Basic count for ONE TO TEN?  Maybe better, basic scale?  ",

				"commentBody": "I live in the Midwest; I have observed that ALL restaurants have increased prices about 20-30% in the last few years (2-3 years). Grocery prices were going up even before this.<br/><br/>It is true that egg and milk prices spiked last year, and have come way down since. But how long will that last? Milk was up to $4.30 a gallon and eggs at least $3.25 (and I am talking \"conventional' and not organic!). It was scary. Not unlike $4 a gallon gas!<br/><br/>But did prices really moderate....or did the government intervene, so that people were in a \"happy place\" for the elections? I am suspicious each election cycle, no matter which party is in power! it's all too easy to do this on a temporary basis.<br/><br/>But groceries are MORE than eggs and milk, and restaurant prices have STAYED very high. 2-3 years ago, every fast food place had a \"dollar menu\" that was a huge bargain. Today, those \"dollar items\" are renamed \"value menu\" and cost $1.50 to $1.80 each. That is an 80% increase in 24 months! and if you have kids, and they want McD.....that's sticker shock.<br/><br/>Family style restaurants have gone up even more. There are no more $7.99 specials. Everything is well over $12, even salads and chicken dishes.<br/><br/>I can't speak for fancier eateries, as my budget rarely permits going to them.",

							"commentBody": "Concerned Citizen, I agree with you about food prices being already high (I live in Chicago, a very expensive place to buy groceries, both because of the high food prices and the tax(es) on all grocery items). The probably temporary drop in milk and egg prices is of no benefit to me, since I don't buy either item. <br/><br/>I also agree with you that McDonald's is not inexpensive at all--for what they sell, I have found it high-priced for years (as a vegetarian, I don't eat most of what they sell, but I will buy French fries sometimes), and others agree with me. (I also agree with you about Walmart not being that inexpensive for what they sell; although not a Walmart shopper myself, I checked grocery prices while on an errand for a friend and was not impressed). I think another commenter mentioned almost-cold food: McDonald's on W. Fullerton off of Elston in Chicago, you are guilty of this (I thought I'd take the opportunity).<br/><br/>The kind of 1970s health-food cafes that I liked are long, long gone in the major metros (perhaps they survive in some college towns, but I wouldn't know), but except for occasional take-out, which may only mean a few baked goods, I think many Americans don't really have money to spare for eating out. The taxes alone are money that you will never get back. Many people just don't have the disposable income anymore.",

				"commentBody": "Dining out (in most cases, but not all, e.g. high end and ethnic places) is not worth the price.   With the tremendous portions, it is not good for your health, either.<br/><br/> Fast Food has particularly gone downhill.  I had a hamburger in a pub in London last year, and I could not believe how fantastic it tasted.   It was simply because the beef was sourced from outside the industrialized U.S., and not full of antibiotics and other additives.   <br/><br/>Years ago, I enjoyed a meal at McDonald's.   Not anymore: it simply does not taste like anything recognizable.    Wendy's created by Dave Thomas has gone downhill after it was bought by corporate raider Nelson Peltz.   It is no longer, good solid Ohio fast food - it is leveraged buyout food.   It tastes like it, and the service is inferior.<br/><br/>I still like In 'N Out in the west.    It is family owned, and the people who work there give good, friendly service - probably due to their higher wages and health insurance.<br/><br/>Chains are usually inferior.   You can make that stuff at home.   A prime steak you can make at home, and not pay a la cart for the sides.   Dim Sum, Korean or Thai - one goes out for those.   A special occasion at a high end resort or Beard-award restaurant with a well known chef - that's good too.<br/><br/>Only a fool like Donald Trump eats out constantly.",

Yes, I could find my own new recipe, go to the store and buy the ingredients for less cost, but I can try something different with unusual ingredients and not have to buy a large bottle of something I decide I really don't like that well and end up throwing out. Also I don't have to decided on a recipe (after a long day that's sometimes helpful!) and I don't have to go to the store -- a plus for me since I live out of town. I like that the ingredients are fresh and the meats good quality -- the overall quality of the meal is certainly much better than a fast and/or casual restaurant and the food much more interesting. I don't use Blue Apron weekly -- just occasionally as the menus appeal to me. I do end up adding some of their recipes to my regular cooking so in the end I do save money there. Bottom line for me it's just an option to augment home cooking.",

It amazes me sometimes how many restaurants, food stands, delis, and grab-and-go spots manage to stay in business -- even with the population here -- given the prices, and I'm also amazed at how many people routinely pay 300-500% more than grocery store prices when they buy things like yogurt on the go from places like Starbucks, etc.  I make a decent salary and it pains me when I don't bring my lunch and I wind up having to fork over close to $8 for a basic turkey sandwich from a random deli.  Total waste of money.   I love trying restaurants but I need to feel like I'm putting the money towards something unique that I can't just make at home.<br/><br/>A food budget in NYC can actually be quite reasonable if you plan, grocery shop, and watch sales.  I routinely buy things like cereal, snack foods, paper towels, cleaning products and other commercially packed goods from CVS because they run specials on those items frequently.   The rest comes from grocery stores like Trader Joes, Fairway, and Whole Foods while eschewing other grocery stores and bodegas that will definitely upcharge (yes, Whole Foods wins in a fight against Gristedes).  Overall, I haven't found grocery bill much worse than shopping in the suburbs.  It's the rent that kills here!",

The restaurant business has many workers and some can have quite disgusting habits and dirty, filthy premises, lack of training and NO PAID SICK DAYS! So employees come to work in kitchens everywhere to prepare your food who are very ill. Sneezing and coughing and runny noses and all.<br/>I'm surprised more people don't get sick from eating out. Maybe they would if they knew the truth of matter. I like clean, safe and ultimately healthier food made at home for myself and family and friends. It always tastes much better too. I'm tired of paying for expensive, inferior meals at most places. As a rule of thumb avoid any place with a deep fry-o-lator machine.",
