				"commentBody": "\"I don't know about the rest of you, but VW has only offered $10.1k per car, not $20k.\" <br/><br/>According to the VWGOW claims web site, after entering the VIN and other info, the buyback amount for my 2011 SportWagen TDI with ~53000 miles on it now is $14k. The additional compensation is ~$6k. Total is $20k. <br/><br/>I don't understand how the buyback value or the additional money were determined. I am going to the library tomorrow to look for a print copy of the Kelly Blue Book from last September so I can look up the resale value. Given that these cars were previously touted for their excellent resale value, $14K after 4 \u00bd years for a car that was $29k new seems low-ball. I guess they're using the dealer-trade-in number instead of the private-party resale number, or maybe they're just playing a game of take it or leave it. But by offering only $14k for the buyback, they're establishing the ceiling of the resale value, and when the firmware updates that fix the problem come out and drivers see the performance hit, the resale value will go even lower.<br/><br/>I suppose I could sell the car back to VW, wait for them to fix it, then come back and offer $9k for my old car.",

There a plenty of racists, but there are few that have the instincts to utter the absurd comments that seem to create the spectacle created by Mr. Trump.  My evidence is using the random walk statistical methodology, I only watch CNN at lunch and Mr. Trump was the marquee topic most of the time.  This was many months prior to the convention.  I think the relationship was mutually beneficial and still is.  It is the only explanation for the success of his being non politically correct and disrespectful of politics (Congress can be bought and I know it because I have bought them) patois that captured the TV ratings, media clicks, and print ink.<br/><br/>Trump is a legendary con.  It is obvious.",

What happened at JFK was quite clearly the latter. We have become a sad, frightened country. Kind of pathetic.",

At the end the original 10 is now two hundred fifty. While the comparison is not perfect the stakes are also different in medicine versus theology. <br/><br/>How about we publish this, \"medical mistakes are really not good things and can kill people.

He didn't ask for changes on his signature issues like trade and immigration, but only on this obscure Russia-related issue that I would not have guessed he even knew about.  It's odd, especially in reference to his antipathy for NATO and fondness for Putin.<br/><br/>You see the problem?
