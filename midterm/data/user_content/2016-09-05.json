You can see some large wave events for this famous bodyboarding beach.",

							"commentBody": "If a woman wants to cover herself at the beach... If a woman wants to walk topless on the beach.... Doesn't matter. This is her right in any western society. A burkini doesn't even cover the face. There is no security issue. We shouldn't be letting ourselves get to the point of forcing others to take off their clothes to live more peacefully. There's no sense in that. It's a swimsuit designed by an Australian, initially aimed at Muslim women (and others) living in the West to help them participate in popular Western cultural activities. The burkini is a sensible choice if you want to go swimming without revealing too much of your body, for whatever reason. To call it provocative is ridiculous. What of the freedom for which the French had a revolution?<br/><br/>Spouting racist undertones is a 'provocation' says every right minded person on the planet. People with an ounce of humanity have labelled Sarkozy a \"provocation\" that supports radical racism, as a heated debate rages on whether he is a supporter of FN. Forcing a woman to remove her clothes is a militant act, it's provocation that supports radical anti-Islamic sentiment. A lot of parents are putting their children in kids wetsuits rather than trunks / cossies these days. The sun is dangerous, nobody wants dirty old men eyeing up their kids, covering up is good and long may it continue.<br/>IA<br/><a href=\"http://www.londonschoolofislamics.org.uk\" title=\"http://www.londonschoolofislamics.org.uk\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.londonschoolofislamics.org.uk</a>",

The internet connection was lost when we returned from Maine. <br/><br/>BTW, the worst segments of the entire holiday were the cab rides to and back from the airport in Chicago. Otherwise the entire trip could not have been better.<br/><br/>So, after calling AT&amp;T, which is a wonderful provider (I know because I spent hours on the phone today before they told me they couldn\u2019t help me), we determined it was the 5 year old router and not the 14 year old modem. I bought a new router, which AT&amp;T didn\u2019t like and eventually sent me to the maker which told me how to connect in 10 minutes (after AT&amp;T kept giving me bad advice for two hours).<br/><br/>I wish I could feel sorry for how the Cubs treated your Giants but I don\u2019t.<br/><br/>The puzzle is Tracy-worth.<br/><br/>Prepared ribs and chicken for tomorrow\u2019s Labor Day BBQ with the Chicago family. <br/><br/>Never looked at a puzzle the entire time I was gone. <br/><br/>Maine is not another state.

I'll tell you what's bizarre... An election cycle in which everything but the issues of the day are debated. An election cycle in which the favorite to win hasn't given a press conference in nearly 280 days. An election cycle in which voters are disgusted by money in politics and the havoc it is wreaking and Paul Krugman wondering why there is criticism of the Clinton Foundation.<br/><br/>Well, for all the good it does - and hardly anyone denies it does do good - when you're Secretary of State or President of the United States, you're not supposed to be connected to an institution that accepts money from corporations and foreign entities, including Ukrainian nuclear power concerns at a time when nuclear power is on your list of to-do's at State. You're also not supposed to nominate donors to sensitive boards. But Clinton did nominate Rajiv Fernando. It looks bad, even when the intentions are the best. <br/><br/>Clinton, especially in view of the scrutiny she has always been under, should totally disconnect. If Bill is to have a job in her administration, then they should put the foundation in mothballs.

Hence she set up a private server in order to hide that. She deleted records she had the experience to know enough to keep well she had her lawyers do her dirty work in order to maintain plausible deniability). she did exactly the same thing with mills and Huma. they did the dirty work (that's why they still are there) and she pleads I don't recall. When folks raised the issue of her server, another henchman for clinton said don;t mention it again. There is no direct evidence because the entire set up if she was caught was designed to make sure there was no direct evidence. I'm afraid if one examines the entire set of evidence there is no other conclusion. Having aides working for multiple organizations lets them sate they were working in a different role at the time. files were deleted after freedom of information requests. her prior justifications have been proven false for setting up the server. These are just too many improbable coincidences for it to be simple mistakes, or innocent. If you believe otherwise I have a bridge to sell you. I'm a life long dem. Other dems need a reality check. She makes Nixon look good, I watched the watergate hearings as a child ",

I have no idea if he has changed stables or if MSNBC, contrary to its political DNA, has hired on commentators from the deep right. Mr. Castellanos, in a roundtable discussion, said \"the Clinton Foundation is nothing but a slush fund.\" And he topped it off, smirk and glee apparent, with \"Trump is inching up in the polls.\"<br/><br/>It's quite understandable that networks have their biases and their political programming has become boringly predictable (Walter Cronkite, Eric Sevareid, Roger Mudd, where have you gone?) <br/><br/>If one can understand what's being said through the annoying cross-talk, one finds that almost all network political discussion is unfavorably geared towards Mrs. Clinton. And, yes, Dr. Krugman, 2016 feels a lot like 2000. It seems as though one is sitting in a darkened movie house watching a horror film that one has seen before but cannot turn away from the inevitable horrific denouement. <br/><br/>When W. said, in effect, \"hey, have a beer with me,\" the railroad bells and horns and semaphores all went off. The presidency is a serious job, not Animal House. W., unsuited for the office, was used by Dick Cheney, naive fool that he was.

We always know exactly where he stands, and his passion is usually backed up by facts.<br/><br/>Which is what we have here, in his analysis of Trump's pathetic and shameful \"outreach\" trip to Detroit. The evidence that Trump is a bigot (or is at least portraying himself as a bigot for perverse reasons too twisted to understand), is overwhelming and  indisputable.<br/><br/>Bless you, Mr. Blow, for spelling it out. What I'd like to know, though, is why your employer doesn't do the same in its Trump coverage.<br/><br/>The following disclaimer appears at the end of every article about Trump in the Huffington Post: \"Editor\u2019s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims... from entering the U.S.\", with links to proof points of each assertion.<br/><br/>I'm no great fan of HuffPo, but at least they understand the stakes and are willing to spell out the danger Trump poses. I imagine that kind of bluntness must feel distasteful to the Gray Lady's editors, but Trump is a distasteful, repugnant candidate that won the Republican nomination with plenty of help from the media.<br/><br/>It's now time for the media to take off the white gloves and beat back the monster they helped create.",

							"commentBody": "This was just another vaudeville presentation, a close encounter of the Trump kind. It's alarming that so few in the media and nobody in government will hold his feet to the fire. His history of prior bad acts, his pride in success through subterfuge, his cowardly association with seditious travelers, the murky history of his current wife's immigration, his embrace and encouragement of foreign antagonists and his pathetic need for adulation and attention have all been documented, but not so much memorialized. Even taken separately, someone with less of a parade balloon persona would have faced serious consequences and dire legal troubles for any of those transgressions, yet DJT gets a walk. Neither running for office nor running your mouth imparts any immunity. He clearly thinks he's too big to jail (\"I could shoot someone...\"). He likewise thinks most of us are dumb, toothless goobers.<br/>As a showman he has no problem staging a foray into hostile territory, and staged it was. Not just scripted to a tee, but I have to wonder if those few that did attend might have gotten inducements, if not actor's scale. I guess he felt it wasn't worth paying all the extras needed to fill all those empty seats.<br/>I'm guessing he won't attend the debates on some pretext (little league is holding tryouts that night and they wrote him a letter?) Or maybe he has a prior commitment to walk on water somewhere else?<br/>HeyNorris has nailed it. So should the NYT, the DOJ, DHS and such. Pravda not so much.",

I read a column by Ms Dowd, who said that Trump was so bad, everyone must vote for Secretary Clinton in spite of her flaws. The top rated comments were all 'Fire Ms Dowd for lying. Secretary Clinton has no flaws at all.' Certainly, Prof Krugman agrees with those comments.<br/><br/>2. On 29 August, Snopes noted that the Clinton Foundation had received the highest rating by CharityWatch. They noted that CharityWatch is not the best of the charity-rating agencies, and CharityNavigator refused to rate the Clinton Foundation because of irregularities. On 1 Sept, CharityNavigator due to \"unprecedented demand\" not only reinstated the Clinton Foundation's, but gave it their top rating. So, when the Clintons heard about the Snopes article, Bill got on top of things.<br/><br/>3. As Prof Krugman says, one must go by actions, not words. Trump vehemently denies climate change, and has fought against renewable energy. He would be an unmitigated disaster as president.<br/><br/>Someone pointed out that charges that Senator Clinton voted for war, and Secretary Clinton strongly supported war are false to any native English speaker: in plain English, it's only a war if a majority of both houses of Congress vote to call it a war. Military actions to force regime change are NOT wars without that vote, they're just peace-keeping missions.<br/><br/>And Secretary Clinton has promised peacekeeping missions to liberate Syria and Russia as soon as she takes office.",
