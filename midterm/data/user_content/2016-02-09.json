				"commentBody": "I like this puzzle so much I am adding a comment. First the theme is as clean as it is clever. Two word phrases are cleverly and amusingly changed in their meanings with not so strained cluing. And no revealer is needed to understand it. The fill is superb. All the four letter entries are common words. The only exception is ETTE and, when ETTE is the worst entry in a puzzle, it is great construction. And the three letter entries are all legitimate and not strained. That is a lot to ask for a Tuesday puzzle and Ms. Lempel delivers.",

				"commentBody": "Jeff,<br/>I lived in America in the late 20th and early 21 century. It is still great to be middle class in America. Your characterization of Hillary Clinton is right on but Il lived in all of Chicago. I grew up in Montreal where I became used to living and being everywhere in the city. In Montreal I was used to exploring poor White and Black neighbourhoods. I was comfortable in Chinatown, and the wealthiest French Canadian enclave. Today Montreal is integrated, its population is mostly ethnic and you can find Jamaican restaurants next door the East Indian and Thai eateries and find the same people in all the restaurants.<br/>When I go to your Chicago or Hillary and Bill enclaves all I can think about is the old Phil Ochs song, Love me I'm a Liberal. I think of high schools only a couple of miles apart where one has a campus of broken asphalt and one has a theatre program worthy of the most generously endowed liberal arts college.<br/><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u52Oz-54VYw\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u52Oz-54VYw\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u52Oz-54VYw</a><br/>Quebec had its quiet revolution in the 1970s. Do you expect America's underclass to wait 200 years till they have their own Irish Potato Starvation.<br/>It is over 50 years since Kennedy was murdered and things have not improved for far too many. It was only 25 years after Quebec's revolution when suddenly your doctors lawyers and business executives did not all come from fine middle class backgrounds.",

				"commentBody": "Odd. I go from reading Bill Clinton as he opines that some unknown, sinister group of young men (aka The Bro's) have been speaking ill of his wife - even going so far as to use the word \"profane\" in describing the dreadful crimes committed by these internet hooligan's - then return to a novel about Kit Marlowe being interrogated by the Bishop for possibly associating with a 'bad' group who have questioned the faith and displeased the Queen. In the 16th century. In 2016, the accusation is misogyny. In Elizabethan England, it was \"atheism\". In both instances, the point was to throw the mud and protect those in power. Are we truly to believe that some hot-headed crack by an over-excited 19 year old presents a threat to the former Secretary  of State? (Or that a poet in the 1590's was going to take down Christendom) Nonsense in both instances. You want misogyny, Bill? Try Walmart. Your wife was the director, you might recall. ",

My vote does not have anything to do with personalities. <br/><br/>My vote is for the better qualified candidate who has the better chance of winning the general election. That person is HRC in my estimation.<br/><br/>People who call themselves Sanders supporters have launched a series of attacks against Mrs. Clinton and her husband. You did.<br/><br/>In fact, the attacks are so vicious and misogynistic in some cases that I have to believe they are from Republicans posing as Sanders supporters. <br/><br/>Senator Sanders runs on issues, so it is tough to reconcile that with the hate speech from some corners of his supporters.",

It's a saying as old as the hills, older than even Bernie. <br/><br/>Have a good night, and please do vote in our primary in April.

What a bunch of corrupt money grubbers. Get off the stage. Bill and Hillary do not seem to be in robust heath as well reeling on Humma. They run the money losing $2BB Clinton Foundation with over $200MM of annual income at  staggering loss employing their own employees , not usual. Go way. The only reason HC is running for President is the final of about 10 coverups- The Clinton Foundation will run out of donors if she loses and fold. Absolute Hypocrisy .

It is a terrible job, and the only reason I can see for applying for it is that a person has an over-arching belief in actions that will benefit the nation, and a passion for the good of the country.<br/><br/>I don't hear that from Hillary at all.  <br/><br/>Bernie articulates it well, I think of him as inner-directed.  His has the strength of his convictions, and his convictions have resonant appeal.  Hillary appears to be other directed with herself at centre stage, and no true convictions or vision.",

If the president could truly lead a revolution wouldn't Obama have realized more of that hope and changed he promised? He admitted in his final state of the union that the country is now more divided than when he started. The unfortunate job of president in today's political reality is not about rising up against the man but negotiating, deal making, horse trading, and making consistent incremental improvements. Obama did make advancements and much more work needs to be done but the fantasy of the people rising up when we have a deeply divided country is incredibly naive. Do you think the Trump supporters are going to join the Bernie bandwagon? ",
