				"commentBody": "The division in these comments is about the role of punishment vs the role of accountability. Ms Clark has shown that she holds herself deeply accountable for her role in this crime. There is no repair for murder, but does punishment accomplish any sense of peace or healing for victims? Other countries limit incarceration time, even for the most serious crimes. Ms Clark has done the only repair she could: to be accountable and to dedicate herself to the wellbeing and growth of others. Is the sum of judgement only for the worst deed we've ever done? If we want an effective criminal justice system, it must include the possibility of growth and acts of reparation. Truth and reconciliation. Punishment is ultimately a futile  act, a form of violence in response to violence. It is ineffective and unfairly meted out. We need a radical transformation in our criminal justice system from punishment to containment of violent offenders and intensive efforts at restorative justice and accountability.",

							"commentBody": "@Frank:  Of all the comments here on all sides, the one I find least comprehensible is your statement:  \"I would wait at least five more years to make it an even forty years served.\"  What in the world do a few years and an \"even number\" have to do with anything, here or anywhere?  That is just a contrived notion that is meaningless.  Far better for everyone to discuss the vast gap between benevolence and revenge as discussed by many.  I find it hardest to accept the vengeful statements; it feels more like blind anger than thoughtful or inward-contemplating commentary.  As a thought - Norway normally releases murderers after no more than 45 years, the thought behind this being that prison is for correcting people more than for punishing people.  The recidivism rate in Norway is far lower than in the US, and the prison conditions are far, far different - more humane and definitely designed for rehabilitation, not for reducing already-damaged individuals to the level of animals.  I understand the punishment argument and the rehabilitation argument, and do not need anyone to come up with the old line, \"What if it were your family who were murdered?\"  It is a very difficult decision everyone must make, personally and internally, not a mob decision.",

I believe many have been swayed by this argument, and almost feel that when we commute the sentence of such a person we are violating a contract with those prior death sentence supporters.  Richard Speck is long dead, but Charles Manson and others are still incarcerated. Couldn't their sentences be someday commuted?  This good deed has a price.",

Never is that more so than among friends - especially friendships formed in youth.<br/>An elderly minister friend of many years spoke of a parishioner he visited. Her husband had been a Dutch Army major in the East Indies during WW2. A cryptographer who didn't return to Europe after the war.<br/>When he died, she was elderly, alone, and partially disabled by arthritis.<br/>Yet, she followed a routine and stoically faced each day reassured by regular visits from an understanding minister. Eventually he retired and I visited her during a canvass. What a remarkable person! scintillating conversation. Filled with stories and interest. She was radiant and alive in the presence of someone who could relate to that period of history and the circumstances of its time.<br/>I lived far away and was immersed in distracting work. So, I left word with my friends successor about the importance of visits. But, no one came.  After a few months she gave up and died.<br/>There are many definitions of \"friend\".<br/>The one I like best is that a friend is a person who believes in you when you don't. But it can be more than a person.<br/>My mother lived to 99+ (with no meds). She preferred solitude and her constant companion were the scriptures of her faith.<br/>Friends are people, or can be activities, or pets that reunite us with our youth. For whatever we hold to be true is what we recall from our youth as the result of a friend.",
