				"commentBody": "The GOP has been fracturing for a decade or longer, right back to the Bush years when they broke their promises to the evangelicals. The Tea Party arose out of this frustration and Trump came out of their anger. The bottom line is that there is a vast gulf between the urban educated Republican and the uneducated (\"I love the uneducated\" Trump) white middle and lower middle classes. <br/><br/>Only by using code words - the most obvious recent one being \"Hillary\" - to paper over the fracture, has the GOP been able to prevent a split from occuring. Trump accelerated the split because he uses language that incite the redneck GOP but repel the more educated ones. <br/><br/>Clearly, the GOP hoped to get through this presidential cycle with a Bush or Rubio but Trump trumped them all. The party probably should separate into two distinct conservative parties. These two can then work together, along with the Democrats on some issues to get Congress moving. Moderate GOPers should jettison the tea party people. ",

Trump's (repeated) misogynistic, predatory comments are made in public, and have been over a period of decades. He's a repeat offender.<br/><br/>I'm wondering why you'd have trouble with a young woman saying she was sexually assaulted. Your candidate trotted out Bill Clinton's accusers and cynically used them as a photo op. Why is that okay, and why are their accusations given more credence than those of a woman (not a \"young lady\") who accuses a man of assault? Or does that standard exist for everyone else except the admitted predator Trump?",

Although I never heard him claim that it was OK or appropriate.  If it had come to light in 1992 it might have cost him the Presidency.  But he isn't running for anything.

It requires all of us to teach ourselves and our neighbors better...it requires that we all remember who we are, how we came to be so comfortable with celebrating Christopher Columbus when he was, in fact, the seed that planted genocide and lies for what became this forest of warped citizenry. Wake up...your limited view of truth is part of what lies at the heart of our racial turbulence...I think you meant well but we are too far gone to allow that to be enough. Go back to your statement \"perhaps rightly\" and re-think just how \"rightly\" we are to think this is not everyone's country!",

As a citizen of this great country, it reminds me why we must defeat Trump whose position as a presidential candidate legitimizes the basest instincts of some people. By soundly defeating Trump, we show the world, and most importantly show ourselves, that racism, misogyny and religious profiling are not tolerated by the majority in the United States of America. By joining force to defeat Trump as citizens regardless of our race, religion, sexual orientation, or even political affiliation, we show ourselves that the path to a better world is being together. By defeating Trump, we will know that a better world is possible. Because knowing a better world is possible, it will be.  ",

My street is lined with centarian pin oaks that tend to come down in this kind of storm, usually falling across the street. One did so in the park a half-block from  my house, taking out the power lines. Excavations and repairs took 3 days, but I had refuge at my daughter's place.

Sections of I-95 and I-40 are closed b/c of flooding.  Rivers are rising for the next couple of days and people are worried about dams breaking.<br/><br/>We own a condo at Hilton Head--they're just now (3pm Tuesday) lifting restrictions and letting people come back onto the island.  Huge numbers of trees down, especially off the main roads.  We're waiting to find out what happened in our neighborhood; the property managers haven't been able to get in and assess the situation.  Some power is back on, some water &amp; sewer is working, but not all.  It's a mess.",
