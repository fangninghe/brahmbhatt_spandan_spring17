I cannot believe that the governmental agency that lets a flood of undocumented labor into the country would put bureaucratic obstacles in the path of this girl. The trillions wasted in Afghanistan chasing Taliban would be much better spent on scholarships and online classes for women and men like her. The second villain is self-evident. The religion/culture that threatens a woman with acid because she wants to learn calculus is barbaric, savage and unworthy or respect. And yes, religion and culture are inseparable.",

In places like Turkey, Indonesia and Iran women are able to attain an education without any violence. So perhaps rather than branding an entire religion as the 'villain', maybe it's the radical interpretation of a religion by extremists that we should be looking at. ",

The Taliban is so retrograde, and so ignorant of the ways of the world, that Afghanistan must push to block these religious dogmatic thugs, hypocrites using the most advanced technology that education provides (witness the weaponry at their disposal, thanks to rich donors from Saudi Arabia, Catar, etc), and yet try to forbid and destroy their own people eager to learn and advance science and improve their own day-to-day lives. Radical Islam's return to the dark ages is a warning, that secular education is not carried out so their society may, one day, escape its dependency on others; instead, a free and proud people capable of deciding their own destiny.",

				"commentBody": "Great comment. Your primary residence is mainly an expense, not an investment. In my view, whether it is feasible trying to transform it into an investment is a matter of how much disposable income you have. If it isn't far above four figures, you'll probably be better off saving and maximizing your contributions to things like IRA accounts or 401k's. Basically, if your problem is not having to figure out how to invest a large disposable income, you probably should not think of buying a home; unless a truly good opportunity presents.  ",

When buying a condo, it's important that your circumstances are similar to those of your neighbors and are likely to be so long term.  For example, in growing areas, it's common for condos to be starter homes, and for people to move up when they have a kid or two.  That can mean that five years from now you'll be living in a rental community because the those moving up couldn't get their price.  It also means that the absentee owners are unwilling to pay increased common charges and maintenance becomes minimal.",

I remember a time when home ownership was done because people needed a place to live and families to raise.  It seems to me that this is no longer part of the American Dream.  I have put my co-op apartment up for sale because I just don't want to live in the same place that I have lived in for the past fourteen years.  I'm unattached and would like to experience a different part of the city.  And I agree with the others- owning really is a big headache, but I did enjoy the tax breaks, but off to a new adventure!",

The ones doing the race-baiting, divisiveness, lawlessness, hating, ignorance and gross incompetence are the Congressional Republicans! They are the ones who hold the entire country hostage by refusing to do THEIR JOBS. The only thing Republicans have done in the past 8 years is to behave like spoiled, rich kids who can't find a way to not be held responsible for the crimes they've committed! Each time Obama has tried to compromise they refuse to negotiate in good faith, acting more like kindergartners who've not yet learned to share. <br/><br/>I have no idea what country or state of illusion you have been living in for the last 8 years, but it is decidedly NOT the same one I've been living in. After years of financial starvation under Bush, the VA was a mess. It IS getting better. I know this to be a fact! And it would be a whole lot further along in it's re-haul if  Congress would appropriated the funds needed to do this!!!! But the Republican held congress refuses. They refused to obey the Constitution in doing their JOB to hold confirmation hearings to fill the supreme court vacancy!! As for the economy, Bush trashed it. Obama had to clean it up. He's done a fine job of that. Can you do better? Would it just be more trickle down economics which we ALL know doesn't work? Trump is unfit in every way to be president",

After 8 years of Obama the Obama V.A. is still killing our veterans, and lines to get through airport security are far worse than they have ever been and getting worse, not to mention that Obama has given us the worst economic growth under any President since the Great Depression.\"  You are talking about the wrong period - that was the presidency of George Bush when the economy tanked - do you remember at the end of his presidency when the job market was shrinking by 800,000 jobs?????  President Obama has made heroic efforts, they had to be heroic because of the opposition he faced from the GOP who did not want Americans to recover so that he would not be re-elected.  How did that work out for you?  And you can blame those long lines at TSA on the GOP who hold the purse strings and have cut funding to allow increased staff to service the increased traffic at airports with the improved economy.  So, sure vote for Trump who will just blow up the whole world when he gets ticked off with Putin!! ",

So a single person or young couple might rent a one or two bedroom apartment.  But they buy a three bedroom house.<br/><br/>Buying a house is more of a lifestyle choice than an investment decision.  It takes both time and money to maintain a home.<br/><br/>In the interests of full disclosure, I bought a house in the oil patch at the peak of the market at high interest rates just before oil prices collapsed (1981), and was underwater eight years later when I moved to take a new job.  My rental income was less than my mortgage for the next eight years, at which point I sold for 5% more than I paid.<br/><br/>If you live in an area which restricts housing growth, your home is more likely to appreciate than if you live where housing is allowed to expand freely.<br/><br/>You typically pay about a 10% premium for new construction, and in two years your house will no longer be new construction.<br/><br/>If you buy a house with 5% down, you are 5% underwater if you have to sell shortly thereafter.
