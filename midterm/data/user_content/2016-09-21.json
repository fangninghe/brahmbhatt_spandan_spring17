				"commentBody": "The outcry is great.  There's an authentic forum for more intellectual conversations about where and how these problems (Trump) happen.  The outcry helped push Obama into 8 years as POTUS.  My skepticism about these sorts of things lies in the (un)reliability of statistical certainties and the uncouth behaviors stemming from the outdated DNA/lifestyle that is bottle-necking a large proportion of the populace in America.  And, if America is anything these days, it's the land of entitlement, where the worst expect the most, and the best expect it too, only more effectively.  Trump is what we deserve, and even if he doesn't get the presidency, our flirtations with annihilation are so egregious these days, it's only a matter of time before some other hideous reality comes up to bite us.

				"commentBody": "Of course she's telling us what we can and can't watch. By criticizing NBC for putting Trump on the show I think we can assume it's her belief that Fallon should not have had Trump as a guest. If Ms. Bee had her way Trump would not have been on the show and then those who want to watch him would not have been able to, simple as that.<br/><br/>By it's very definition being a liberal means open to new viewpoints. Today's progressives have forgotten that, if they don't like it I can't either.  <br/><br/>She's full of herself and she's not very funny, let's see how long she lasts. Wilmore is gone, Noah's ratings are slumping. It seems that it all really was John Stewart. You can bet Stewart would have had Trump on.",

Many thanks for the correction and my apologies for not being a native born English speaker, but also I would have reflexively expected NYT commentators, of all people, to display a modicum of understanding for the foreign born citizens among us ... Now the main point. Is Samantha Bee criticizing Fallon's genial demeanor with Trump or is she saying that Fallon shouldn't have had Trump on the show at all? I would call the second alternative, if correct, a censuring of the public's right to view, evaluate, and judge the individual in question.  ",

That is true for some parties, but for others the basic goal is the destruction of their perceived enemies. Not everyone wants to stop the killing across the board.<br/><br/>If we want to truly understand the region and maintain any hope for contributing to a lessening of its violence, we must cease the tendency to view what goes on there through the lens of Western political, social, and moral values.<br/><br/>As to Western values, as the U.S. government has determined that it is, in fact, likely this was a Russian airstrike, it would be fair to ask Donald Trump at the first debate what his reaction is. And, for the moderator to be prepared with follow-up interrogatives if necessary.",

They were Iraqis that had allied themselves with Al Queda and other US enemies. My friend, with indignant fervor and anger, challenged these men to explain why they were fighting Americans. They didn't answer the question, but stated that my friend, and other American citizens, should be grateful for their efforts--their retreat action war with the US. This statement stopped my friend cold, because it made no sense.<br/>Their explanation: If the insurgents had not slowed American hubris in Iraq, the war would have spread to an American invasion of Syria and Iran. And then they said, \"The Middle East is a place for Superpowers to spend money, not to fight wars.\"<br/>My friend said, \"There is only one Superpower.\"<br/>The insurgent said, \"Well, if you insist on fighting in the Middle East, there will be NO Superpower.\"<br/>My opinion...George Bush Sr is looking smarter every day.

(Now I can just send them a link to this article instead of taking the time to explain it in my own words. Thanks.)<br/><br/>Beyond the issues that are inherent in modeling a voting population, there are variations introduced by the data gathering method (online vs. telephone, landline vs. cell), languages (English only vs. English/Spanish), potential social bias, and others issues.<br/><br/>I\u2019m not even sure that averaging poll results is even valid, considering the herding tendency.<br/><br/>It's a tough year to follow and interpret poll results.
