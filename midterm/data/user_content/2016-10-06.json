				"commentBody": "b fagan 5 Oct post<br/><br/>Dear mr. fagan, <br/><br/>To deny the uncertainties of the climate-CO2 relationship is to deny the science behind it. <br/><br/>Let's begin with equilibrium climate sensitivity. Decades of research after the Charney report have not reduced the range of climate sensitivity estimates; they have increased it, from 2-4 deg C/2X CO2 to 1.5 to 4.5 deg C/2X CO2. <br/><br/> I see Lindzen calculates &lt; 1 deg C/ 2X CO2, whereas the most whacko models in the CMIP-5 figure 4.7 deg C/2X CO2. <br/><br/>Does that not constitute a bit of uncertainty? <br/><br/>According to Ch 9 of the UN IPCC's AR5, climate models using the same input do not predict SAT within + or - 3 deg C, with the multi-model mean well above observations. Yet we are required to believe that \"climate change\" is \"settled science\"? <br/><br/>I think not. <br/><br/>Or consider the \"social cost of carbon.\" I see numbers ranging from McKittrick's -$5/tonne (a net benefit) to Stern-type numbers on the order of $110/tonne. <br/><br/>I bit of uncertainty there, would you not agree? <br/><br/>Our host Andy has said many times that the best scientists are convinced that SOMETHING will happen due to added CO2 in the atmosphere. However, the magnitude and timing of that something remain uncertain. <br/><br/>It is the uncertainty on the pace, magnitude and nature of climate change due to added anthropogenic CO2 that makes this a \"wicked problem\", in Andy's words. <br/><br/>I agree. <br/><br/>I see many stupid renewable energy schemes pushed forth out of panic over CAGW. <br/><br/>These are counter-productive.

				"commentBody": "Many Ivy League and other leading universities award scholarships to all admitted students who have the need.  Many excellent public universities are inexpensive enough that modest debt and modest wages at part-time and summer jobs can pay for the cost.  Graduates of these schools with relevant majors, excellent references, and standing in the top 20% of their class have a very high likelihood of being hired for an entry level position that gets them on a career track.  <br/><br/>Those whose majors are not highly valued by business, and those with mediocre grades, as well as those with little evidence of commitment to hard work, are unlikely to be hired for positions with a future.   Nonetheless, there are many respectable jobs and ultimately careers for those who eschew college to learn to be a plumber, electrician, butcher, or truck driver.   Insisting that people with talent for paths other than academics go to college is a crime. <br/><br/>And kids who are lazy, unambitious, or who think the world is a party are going to have their lifetime lunch money taken by hard-working kids overseas.   And neither Trump's tariff barriers nor Bernie's free tuition policy is going to help them one little bit. ",

				"commentBody": "The reporting here makes a fundamental error in the first paragraph. Putting aside any systematic errors, when polling 1000 people the statistical error reported as \"+/- 3\" is the standard deviation (or sigma). The result of this poll is an estimate of the true value. The likelihood of the true value lying within a range of +/- one sigma is 68%, not 95%.  The 95% confidence interval corresponds to +/- two sigma, which is +/- 6% in a poll of 1000 people.  This is correctly described in the abstract of the linked paper, but is misstated here.<br/><br/>A related point is that people often tend to over-interpret the stated accuracy of polls. Because polls report their uncertainty as +/- one sigma, this means that even if there were no systematic uncertainties, we should expect the final outcome to lie within the stated uncertainty interval only in approximately 2 out of every 3 polls.",

When polls' margins of error are reported, they typically refer to a 95 percent \"confidence interval\" (CI), which is the CI associated with about 2 standard deviations from the observed mean or proportion.  It very rarely refers to a 68 percent CI, which would be consistent with 1 standard deviation.  If you read the linked paper, this is also what is said there.

				"commentBody": "I grew up in a modest sized town in Idaho, and as one hears rumors, I heard the story of a young woman who lived on the very street where I delivered newspapers, at age 12, in the 1960s.   It was said that at about 16 years of age, she became pregnant, her family was scandalized.   Her 'crime' was having a 'baby out of wedlock'.  <br/><br/>Not once in over a year and a half of walking that street, delivering papers and collecting for this publication, did I ever see this young woman, who was said to still be living in the home, sheltered away.   <br/><br/>It is no joke that in the most conservative parts of this nation, young women who are sexually active and become pregnant, though we are no longer supposed to say so, are still seen as pariahs.   But better the baby be born and for the woman to bear the shame of it.   <br/><br/>Isn't this a basic part of the 'true conservatives' mantra, that women of all ages must be controlled, their sexuality not expressed and heaven help them if they become pregnant.   After all, it's all 'in God's hands', so 'they' say.",

For those things that grow in water, promote their growth and let them sink to the bottom of the water. Pay forest managers to \"harvest\" carbon dioxide and create water storage. Agree on \"sustainable\" or \"renewable\" as something that is not depleted in a human life span. Ogallala Aquifer?<br/>Trivia question. In photosynthesis, which molecule provides the oxygen?

Turning them into energy (or mulch or animal bedding) is a way to extract some value from them and also avoid devastating forest fires.
