				"commentBody": "The other night I attended a high-powered gala in LA. 100s of guests, lotsa stars, famous hotel. While I don't doubt 'security' personal were somewhere, neither did I notice it. <br/><br/> No bags were opened, no lines, nobody forced thru carcinogenic scanners operated by dull-wits.<br/> No one ordered to place valued possessions outside of view- and not dare touch them until deemed allowable by some clerk. No shoes were removed.<br/><br/> Our fixation on airplanes and ballparks is ruining us; is a global embarrassment- and the Security Theater for the now pre-criminalized customer, is mostly pointless, particularly once cockpit doors were reinforced and passengers learned not to acquiesce.<br/> We are all losing countless hours to utter madness. (And this does not include the nonsense of measuring liquid essentials into magical tiny bottles and baggies- or re-buying necessities upon arrival. Unproductive busywork is not the mark of a great society). <br/><br/> TSA has never caught a terrorist and fails 95% of tests, while only airlines have a stake in anyone's safety.<br/> With the outsized importance we place on planes (not the 1000s of ppl stacked in queues) a visitor to this planet might wonder: How come these Earthlings don't \"protect\" themselves everywhere?<br/> I must ask all the alarmists- how ever do u 'feel safe' in a restaurant unless every last bag-n-brastrap is 'inspected' by an otherwise-unemployable? Or is it that you're only willing to grind society to a halt at the airport because, logic? ",

The TSA screeners are clearly bored since they have nothing to do. In Chicago, there are many screeners but a good number are milling around looking official but doing nothing. Probably not their fault - following union orders to do only the job assigned. Nothing more maddening than having no trays for items while they just pile up at the other end and no one makes a move to help out. A good example why people think government doesn't work particularly well.",

About 2000 of them have power, and they are of course extremists by definition.<br/><br/>They sit on top of about 28.5 million Saudi's, 20 million of whom are the hated, and feared Shiites, who live, and work in the Eastern Shiite Crescent, where of course all of the oil is.<br/><br/>Ibn Saud made the deal with Wahabi, in order to be anointed by them King of Saudi Arabia, and the Guardian of Mecca. Wahhabi crowned the head of the house of Saud in the same sense and for the same reasons, that the Pope crowned Charlemagne Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. If the Great Charl was not holy, then he was just another robber baron whose legitimacy rested upon extreme violence, and the same is true of the King of the extremely violent drone Princes of the Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>The Princess hate the Shiite ostensibly because they are apostates, but let's face it, Baharin exists so that the Princes can sip Scotch and taste blondes, without arousing censure at home. Shiites are considered a never ending threat because they are the labor force, which enables cheap oil extraction through cheap labor, and of course they occupy the vital border area between Iraq, and homeland reserves.<br/><br/>The purpose of Princely Sunni Terrorism is to tame the Shiites, while extracting labor, and obstructing by violence Persian pipeline ambitions for Europe and Asia.",

Shouldn't representatives of the nations that committed those actions apologize for intentionally targeting civilians?\"<br/>Yes, they should. But obviously you can think that and still think that the US President should apologize for bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br/><br/>\"But Japan hasn't even apologized for its crimes!\"<br/>Japan has apologized for the war. But more to the point, the victims of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and their families don't have anything to apologize for. They didn't commit those atrocities; the Japanese government did.<br/><br/>\"But the bombings were justified! They ended the war.\"<br/>It's not clear that that justifies targeting civilians. You can't normally kill innocent third parties to realize a morally worthwhile end. But even if the bombings were all things considered justified, they were still prima facie wrong. When you do something that's generally wrong, even though you have exceptional reasons that make it justified in just this case, you may still owe an apology and possible further reparative steps. If I'm caught in a blizzard and see your unoccupied cabin, I have all things considered good reasons to break in to survive. But that's still a violation of your rights, so I owe you an apology and possibly reparations for doing so. I can't just tell you, \"tough luck, my act was justified.\" I have to address a breach of your rights even if that breach was (exceptionally) justified.",
