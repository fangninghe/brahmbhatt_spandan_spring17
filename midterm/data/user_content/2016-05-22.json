Police seldom make arrests unless that think the person is dangerous. They just escort the person out of the restroom and away from the premises with instructions not to return.   In nightclubs and bars, the waitresses or bartenders just call the bouncers. These types of incidents occur every day. ",

George Orwell was wrong about doublespeak, right? <br/><br/>Genitalia police are certainly not required, as the enforceability of this law comes down to what gender the US citizen feels they are at any given moment, says what their gender is, and has nothing to do with what gender their genitalia are. <br/><br/>That's the whole beauty of this law, it can't be enforced as anyone can claim to be any gender. But this is certain to generate a lot of cash for lawyers as now gender police can haul allegedly false transgender Americans to court to prove they feel like a man or a woman when their genitalia says there a woman or a man or visa-versa,. You certainly must see how great this law is for lawyers, and why it got the stamp of approval from America's top constitutional lawyer. It's a win-win for American lawyers. ",

It\u2019s not a problem for women of the town; they simply use their home bathrooms, but Carol notices that farm women who come to town in their horse-draws wagons refuse to use the gender-neutral facility. Rather than share a restroom with men, they trek out onto the prairies until they can find a tree or bush to squat behind. Carol collects contributions from storeowners to construct a public restroom for women only. It is her first major achievement of her campaign to bring enlightenment to Gopher Prairie. ",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>Not a preveal:<br/><br/>JFC, you may recall that 1 day you used a photo of Orson Welles, but it turned out the actual Avatar was something else pertaining to the 1938 Halloween broadcast of \"War of the Worlds\".<br/><br/>Well, the cast and crew of that radio play are all gone now. The last one passed away this month, aged 99. He was apparently interviewed quite regularly about the ability of the broadcast to scare people. The NYT obit has some nice lines about how massively non-credible the thing was. <br/><br/>But he had another claim to fame: He was the regular customer of Sardi's who had been going there the longest. The original Sardi used to let him run a tab, because the theater business can be fickle. At one point, the guy had a steady job at the place next door to Sardi's, which lacked a toilet. So their acquaintance was helpful there as well.<br/><br/>I will believe that he was the Sardi's regular who had been going there the longest, but I'm sure the Times was wrong on what year he began going there. (Check NYT Corrections pages; they almost always have to correct simple facts in obits. For example, the NYT wedding announcement for Morley Safer's daughter said she was keeping the name Safer; but in his obituary, NYT used a different surname for her. The Correction blames CBS for the error.)<br/><br/>The guy went to college in Pittsburgh, then came to NYC; but NYT says he'd gone to Sardi's for 82 years.<br/><br/>Anyway, one play staged by Mercury Theater in 1938 was \"Too Much Johnson\". Can I type that??",
