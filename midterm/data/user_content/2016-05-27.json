It is that she will be running against a candidate who throws so much dirt that some of it is bound to stick. <br/><br/>Trump is just the latest and most effective member of the cottage industry that's been going after the Clintons for decades.  Even though she is probably no more venal than most other politicians, Hillary has accumulated plenty of baggage over a long career, some real but most of it invented.  It's just a fact of life that it will be used against her, and it should not be disqualifying.  BUT - the Democratic Party's managers should have known better than to invest everything in a single candidate to win the White House rather than providing a level playing field for all willing candidates.  <br/><br/>And that, dear readers, is why Bernie should go all the way to the convention.  Neither he nor Hillary will get there with enough pledged delegates.  The superdelegates may turn out to be a good idea after all, a safety valve of sorts.  Depending on events between now and the convention, maybe enough of them will get cold feet and switch.   ",

We need another space program: Tang is getting stale.<br/><br/>A few days ago I introduced the idea, tongue-in-cheek, of building space elevators tethered to satellites in geosynchronous orbits -- immense engines in the elevators would filter the atmosphere, returning it free of carbon, that would be compacted and launched from the top of the elevators on ballistic orbits into the sun. 50 year of this, no more global warming -- probably set us on a path to global weather control what with so much atmospheric movement. They eventually could be self-funding if you built-out the elevators and put casinos in them, the whales in the upper strata with the bodacious views, the blue-hairs closer to ground with their nickels and pennies.<br/><br/>Imagine the new technologies we'd need to develop to do something like this.<br/><br/>But, alas, we're all caught up in funding immense free cheese and Band-Aid factories instead, so we don't do great things anymore. Heck, we don't even effectively defend ourselves anymore.<br/><br/>We can overcome and mange the risks, Mark.

And when asked for her emails by the FBI, she wiped 30,000 of them (a federal crime). She lied about having permission to have a private email server, as revealed yesterday. She's breached American national security, top secret information, and may have caused the failure of US operations - and loss of American lives - in the process. She is corrupt, dangerous, and a liar. She is still lying. She always lies.

He just has to have a starring role, and alot of money.  He can be ignorant because he is cognizant of ratings.  He does not need to ground any platform in facts, or research, or science, because (again), this is a reality show, made for TV.  The reality show star determines who is right, who is a loser, who is little, and who is lying and crooked.<br/><br/>His thoughts on a Trump-Bernie debate are perfect for him: the ratings will be high, and some network will pay alot for it. Further, he can exclude his rival actress (Clinton) which is great in the ratings war.<br/><br/>I now think American will elect this reality show star/clown because he appeals to their entertainment.  Rather than actually do something about anthropomorphic climate change, people can sit on their butts burning oil, or drive as big a gas guzzler as possible because the reality show clown/president will simply change the script so there isn't a disaster on HIS reality show/circus.<br/><br/>As long as Trump is the center ring, being the Ringmaster in Chief, barking out clever insults and phrases, everyone will have popcorn and beer and cotton candy; losers can be ridiculed or maybe even thrown to some lions which will delight the mob.<br/><br/>Who will be the Clown-In-Chiefs running mate?  Simon?  Ryan Seacrest?  Jerry  Springer?  Someone to complement the Circus-Barker-in-Chief.",
