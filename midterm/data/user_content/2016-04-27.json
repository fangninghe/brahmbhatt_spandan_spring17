It's offensive in that it denigrates Sanders supporters who have been extremely active and involved in supporting the campaign thus far.  It chooses to interpret a vision for 2020 as meaning we're going to sit around doing nothing in the meantime.  <br/><br/>The message has  been clear from the onset that Bernie Sanders (and no one else, for that matter) cannot accomplish much alone.  We need to also ensure those we elect to the open Congressional seats and to our state houses and state legislatures also support the progressive agenda.  We must keep a strong focus and level of commitment and action to ensure our progressive ideals are not lost and not watered down by a DNC establishment White House.  To highlight the urgent need to keep the pressure on and the activism high we need only look back at the result of the last mid-term elections and the pathetic situation in many of the states governments (like Maine).  So, in this respect, I agree with your post.  But, don't characterize us as lazy.  ",

And part of what he signed up for in pursuing the party nomination is joining in with the party nominee if he lost and helping her win,<br/>Everything negative he says from this point on is a referendum on his personal character and whether he is a good and honest candidate.  Every negative word will mean he loses respect within the party and loses influence long term with people he has served with.<br/>Every time he refuses to start working for the party and Hillary forces Hillary to reduce his role in the convention in July, keep him from speaking there, from influencing the platform, from committee seats in congress after the election.

Check out the last sentence of his 4/26/16 concession statement:<br/><br/>\"I congratulate Secretary Clinton on her victories tonight, and I look forward to issue-oriented campaigns in the 14 contests to come.<br/><br/>I am proud that we were able to win a resounding victory tonight in Rhode Island, the one state with an open primary where independents had a say in the outcome. Democrats should recognize that the ticket with the best chance of winning this November must attract support from independents as well as Democrats. I am proud of my campaign\u2019s record in that regard.<br/><br/>The people in every state in this country should have the right to determine who they want as president and what the agenda of the Democratic Party should be. That\u2019s why we are in this race until the last vote is cast. That is why this campaign is going to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia with as many delegates as possible to fight for a progressive party platform that calls for a $15 an hour minimum wage, an end to our disastrous trade policies, a Medicare-for-all health care system, breaking up Wall Street financial institutions, ending fracking in our country, making public colleges and universities tuition free and passing a carbon tax so we can effectively address the planetary crisis of climate change.\"",

She's an imperfect candidate, but the frenzied animosity of too many Sanders supporters has lost all proportion with the real policy options presented to us in this election, to the point where some actually claim to look forward to a Trump presidency if only for the satisfaction of saying \"I told you so.\" It's sad, and has planted the seeds of something akin to a Democratic Tea Party, equally divorced from reality or practical consequences.",

Many people seem to assume that transgender women are simply females trapped in male bodies, but this isn\u2019t true. Transgender people can be heterosexual, bisexual, gay or lesbians, but research conducted at the University of Minnesota \u201c\u201csuggests that the breakdown of sexualities among transsexual women\u2014men who think of themselves as female--is 38% bisexual, 35% attracted to women, and 27% attracted to men.\u201d This means that 73 percent of transgender women are sexually attracted to women and 35 percent are exclusively attracted exclusively to women. It doesn\u2019t mean they necessarily want to have sex with women in public bathrooms, of course, but it is wrong to assume they posed no sexual assault threat. ",
