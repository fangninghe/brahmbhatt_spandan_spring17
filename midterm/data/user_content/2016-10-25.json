We need to go to a single payer system where our good MDs, nurses and other providers can do the work they were trained to do.  We need to provide our medical research scientists with the funding they need to advance medicine through research.  There is enough funding available, the issue is some very wealthy executives and their stockholders take off with these funds leaving the system, the providers and patients scrambling for crumbs. ",

Likewise, many of them have compelling stories (equaling this one). Many of them are written about in fascinating detail, with empathy and sometimes sympathy or pathos.<br/>I would be far less appreciative, much less exposed, to great writing if I only read based on the tally of black versus white, female versus male, protagonists.

The use of force against him is clearly unwarranted,  The police assault against him, and his demise is documented.  The conservative politics that dominate Staten Island and infest the elements of its justice system clearly led to the non-indictment in this case.  It is the most clear-cut case of police violence resulting in the most clear-cut miscarriage of justice in the recent spate of similar cases.  This is the one case that calls out for judicial intervention.  I hope it comes soon.",

There, I'll be triaged, and ultimately be examined and treated in accordance with my issue  as compared to the others present.  Sometimes I've been ushered straight in, sometimes I've had to wait for several hours. In each case however, if further examination - medical imaging in its variety of forms, medication or splinting, stitches, blood work - is required, I'm slotted into the next available space (never more than a couple of hours) and treated accordingly.  Whatever is required is logged into \"the system\" and any health care provider who subsequently looks into what's transpired with me can see what was done, what the results of test etc were, and how it was left.  It's up to me if I choose to fulfill or take the meds (if) recommended and follow-up further if required.  But I've never seen a bill for what I've described, whether in the office, or \"emerg\".
