Cheap money helps real estate to go up as well. But the real point is we need demand side bias policy to escape our supply side disfunction. <br/><br/>Demand side bias policy has to come, mostly, from the political branches of our system. Bernie's trillion dollar infrastructure program would be just a start. A higher minimum wage would probably help. Enhanced bargaining power for workers of all stripes would help to, because, ultimately demand comes from wages. <br/><br/>Congress refused to do anything. So, we are hosed. ",

And if they did, racing them would be like racing snails, or measuring continental drift.<br/><br/>Forgive me if I return to the presenting topic of the Solar Impulse.<br/><br/>I see that it took the Solar Impulse 150 million euros expenditure to reach Hawaii, at which point they paused to raise another 20 million euros to finish their circumnavigation. <br/><br/>Piccard admits that the flight will not transform aviation but rather is to \"raise awareness\", \"educate the common man about clean energy\" and other such vague pseudo-goals. <br/><br/>\"Awareness\" must have been in a truly dismal state, buried somewhere down below the Marianas Trench, if it requires 170 million euros to raise it! <br/><br/>I note however that the Solar Impulse is funded by private money, except for a $6.5 million grant from the Swiss government. <br/><br/>If I were Swiss, I'd be cross.<br/><br/>Since I'm not, I can be philosophical about it.

				"commentBody": "Deductibles and coinsurance have gone through the roof. The average person either never gets to the point where they are actually being reimbursed, or their healthcare providers engage in over-charging simply to get their patients past their deductible and coinsurance hurdles.  <br/><br/>Thus it seems healthcare costs are rising, when really it is rational decision-making by patients and providers to get a fair level of coverage. <br/><br/>Folks often forego non-critical checkups and treatments now to save money since they pay 100% of the costs, which they cannot afford. Putting off healthcare raises the risk of serious illnesses down the road, which not only lowers the quality of life, but also increases future healthcare costs.  These poor decisions are being encouraged by the insurance companies. <br/><br/>The system is SOOO broken. But do not blame Obama. This legislation was the only solution with any chance of passing, to address the worst inequities of the old system (pre-existing illness exclusion and the many uninsured).<br/><br/>One day, single provider will be the only option left to try. \"You can always count on Americans to do the right thing - after they've tried everything else.\" (Winston Churchill)",

				"commentBody": "A much better idea than the Brooklyn-Queens waterfront monorail.  It won't make a huge impact on the city's transit woes in the short term.  But it's an important first step in integrating smaller water craft into the public mass transit system.  There's lots of room to grow this idea, unlike the streetcar.  I would love to see the return of the ferry to LGA that Delta ran briefly in the 1990's: by far the most pleasant way to get to Manhattan from the airport.  <br/><br/>I appreciate the mayor's concern with fairness, but I do believe that it should cost more than a standard subway fare; it should be priced like an Express Bus, so that it has a better chance of succeeding without needing massive subsidies.  Most NYers will see no benefit from this plan and they will not gladly pay for someone else's pleasant commute while they are still packed into 4/5/6 trains.  As the water transit system is expanded, the fare can go down.  And the waterfront developers also need to contribute as waterfront transit greatly enhances the value of their properties.",

It is an efficient way to get from the central business district to the arts and performance spaces on South Bank, or to the University of Queensland and a number of inner-city neighborhoods lining the various bends and turns of the river.  Trains and busses are also provided but for moving around the main parts of the older core of the city nothing can beat the City Cat.  The water ways around the NYC boroughs are not as contorted as the Brisbane River but if the routes were to zigzag from one bank to the other they might serve a lot more people than at first seems possible.

But is there water/sewer infrastructure to support all these new units? What about schools? The topic never even comes up. On S.I. we only have 3 water/sewer treatments facilities for 473,000 people. The newest facility in Oakwood (flood zone) is over 30 years old. No plans for a 4th plant anywhere.",

							"commentBody": "I know what you mean. From my office window in Midtown East, I can see ugly glass boxes springing up like weeds. However, the city has to grow into all five boroughs to maintain its vibrancy because Manhattan will one day will likely become enclave only for the very rich. What existed previously on the river were ugly, polluting factories. Those will never come back, and that is  good thing. The industrial areas of Queens and Brooklyn need to be modernized and made accessible with green spaces, river access and facilities like hospitals, social services, healthy food markets. <br/><br/>I completely agree, though, that developers should be required to do transportation and environmental impact studies on the effect of the additional number of residents that will occupy those glass towers and pay the city and state accordingly rather than getting massive tax breaks for doing what they would have done without the tax breaks.",
