				"commentBody": ".<br/>Martin: More than a bit of a SPACE CADET? This is no Governor Moonbeam. I mean, this guy left an obscene voicemail for a state legislator, and ended it by asking the legislator to make the recording public! It's on YouTube; NSFW.<br/><br/>JFC: Are you and The Wife driving? If so, either get used to it or buy some SOMINEX. She only cares that you get the PITH of what she's saying.<br/><br/>As for your guy, I could have written a letter to his wife saying, \"Yes, Virginia, your husband can bid no-trump.\" And I'm not being political by saying that! It's a straight-up preveal.<br/><br/>As for you in Maine with the family, Martin's right. I have previously given you the link to the guest cottages on Boothbay operated by friends of mine. I realize that was inapt because you don't like people. But if you do need someone to talk to besides the family, Portland has a terrific culture of brew pubs with inventive microbrews. Sit at the bar with some kids who were fired from the Sanders campaign, and listen to them talk about what *they* are going to do next with *their* Revolution. (Now I am being political! My preveal ended way back.)<br/><br/>[Re brewpubs: Maine's a lot like Washington, but they haven't legalized the same intoxicants.]<br/><br/>Come back and tell me how to bet on Maine's Electoral Votes; it's harder than most states with bicameral legislatures because the statewide winner gets 2 Electors, but each House District awards one Elector to its own winner. Ask my school chum, their GOP Chair. Mention Stu &amp; Tara.",

				"commentBody": "US economic growth is demand limited.  Businesses have more than enough capacity to meet current demand without investing in additional capacity.  In addition, oligopolies define far to many industries and that exacerbates low demand.  The oligopolies have sufficient  market power to control prices and maintain profits in a demand limited economy.  The airlines, health care insurers and pharmaceuticals are examples.<br/><br/>We need bold political leadership committed to taking the broad range of actions needed to stimulate demand.  That includes measures ranging from immediate, substantial increases in the minimum wage, increases in funding for education and infrastructure, adding a public option to the ACA, reducing block grants to states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the ACA, repealing tax law provisions that encourage offshoring, breaking up oligopolies and reforming antitrust and patent law.<br/><br/>Hillary Clinton seems more interested in a limited agenda.  Republicans in Congress are likely to pursue scorched-earth obstruction.  We may go from Donald Trump leading \"Lock Her Up\" convention floor chants to Paul Ryan leading House Republicans in \"Lock Her Up\" chants before President Clinton enters the joint session for her 2017 State of the Union address.",

Although he is likely to lose on November 8th, his supporters, including the white working class, remnants of the tea party, and the Alt-Right will remain a force to conjure with unless the Democrats can win the Senate and the House, and pass much needed legislation that will alleviate the problem of low and stagnant wages, institute some modest gun regulations, lower the age for receiving social security benefits for working people but raise it for upper-middle class people and above, make college free or affordable for the children of parents making less than $125,000 a year, and institute apprentice and vocational training for those who want to enter the health professions, skilled manufacturing, and other trades and professions that do not require a liberal arts education.<br/><br/>Unless the federal government can restore the American Dream--basically the idea that people believe their children will lead better lives than they are leading--we will face years of turmoil and worse.",

The criminal justice system here in Chicago is a total joke. Thugs with long rap sheets habitually rotate through revolving doors with the courts. Hillary's answer is to keep thugs on the streets and basically eliminate the 2nd Amendment. <br/><br/>Trump's answer is to let cops do their jobs and crack down on crime. Violent career criminals won't be coddled.<br/><br/>OK, let's hear it: Bbbbbb...but sometimes cops kill the wrong person so it's a terrible idea! It's racist to lock up anyone! <br/><br/>Hmmmm.  OK. Ya know, sometimes corrupt lying career politicians do the wrong thing but they get to run for President. <br/><br/>Highest crime neighborhoods, (and in Chicago it's a fact they're populated mainly by minorities--so this is not a racist statement) are filled with poor people who are terrified to leave their homes. Chicago has beautiful parks but some aren't used by families because the gangs have taken them over. <br/><br/>Trump has said over and over he wants to reduce crime. The Left pretends that crime is almost nonexistent and that those who mention it are just using it as an excuse to lock up more minorities. Never mind the fact that of the 460 + homicides this year alone in Chicago, 75% are black and 19% are hispanic. Google it.",
