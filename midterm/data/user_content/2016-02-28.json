If that doesn't prove perma-stimulus is the true progressive desire then nothing will.  It will always be \"obvious\" to those who benefit most from expanding government that we need more government spending on something.  Meanwhile our highest in the developed world corporate tax rate continues to erode private capital investment   and the wealth creating productivity that comes from that investment.  You can count on government to funnel infrastructure dollars not to where they will do the most good but to where 1) they work to someone's best political advantage and where 2) there is already the greatest failure of progressive policy.  In this latter case the infrastructure spending will actually be counterproductive since it will just prolong the suffering and delay needed structural economic reforms, wasting all of our hard earned tax dollars in the process.",

Oh, sure, we had a little bit back in 2009 and 2010, but most of that came in the form of tax cuts, not actual spending. In fact, the very brief stimulus we had halted the economic collapse and the economy did begin to recover. But slowly, way too slowly! And the effects of that stimulus has long since evaporated.<br/><br/>By the way, did you know that currently most government spending is directed into Republican/conservative states? In Mississippi, for example, literally 47% of the state's annual budget is in fact paid for by Federal tax dollars. The not-liberal Tax Foundation has several times over the last decade detailed how progressive states actually pay far more in Federal tax dollars than they receive in any Federal spending, causing a net loss of billions. Simultaneously, conservative states receive far more in Federal spending than they ever pay in Federal tax dollars, giving them a net gain, thanks to progressives.<br/><br/>And I assume you didn't actually read the column, as conservatives rarely do. Quite clearly, Dr. Krugman pointed out that the Keynesian economic principle is that you implement austerity (aka pay down the debt) at the economic boom times, but you borrow and spend during the slump to boost the economy. Note too, under Clinton we were doing exactly that, quite well. Remember the paid off debt predictions in 2000? Then we got GOP tax cuts and spending...and the debts took off again!",

Like a physician prescribes different medications for different diagnoses and stages of treatments. Conservative ideologues prescribe the same cures for any problem: cut taxes and regs and repeat as often as possible while blaming the government for all ills. W's tax cuts were designed to sunset at the end of the last decade just to get a foot in the door. It took all Obama's efforts and budget brinksmanship to finally end the 3 years late. So it's no wonder that whatever your side is guilty of is projected onto the other side.<br/><br/>The original stimulus was far too small, and primarily dedicated to tax cuts (almost all of which went into personal savings, as predicted) and federal grants to the bankrupt states (forced to cut spending and raise taxes, sending the nation into free fall). The shortfall in infrastructure from the Stimulus was a known accounting amount. You knew it, too. In fact, predictions of waste in shovel-ready investment projects were dead wrong. We know that construction is notoriously the most inefficient in our economy and bid rigging is endemic. Yet these projects were an amazing exception (perhaps because so many firms and workers were so desperate for contracts).<br/><br/>By the way, economists know those federal spending programs (as opposed to the tax cuts) were absolutely free! Why? Because there was zero crowding out of private construction, which was at record lows.",

Many friends of mine are always grousing about one thing or another. Since we live in New York we enjoy the luxury and little consequence to our harrumphing and grumpy attitudes. Except for '72 and '84 we remain true Blue. This convenience allows my colleagues to vote for someone who stands a snowball's chance in Hades of winning, you know, the Ralph Nader types, Green Party enthusiasts, who tell me they're voting for Senator Sanders, and if he loses, then they'll switch to Jill Stein because they \"don't trust\" Hillary. Mind you, these are liberal, highly educated (I love the highly educated) so-called sophisticated folks who one would think would be the last spouting FOX \"News\" talking points.<br/><br/>After the debacle this year, Republicans will probably be instituting super delegates into the mix in 2020, a lesson Dems learned in '72 with McGovern.

If there was one state where black Democrats were more likely to be attracted to the anti-Wall Street message of Bernie Sanders, South Carolina was it. Because obviously Wall Street is the main culprit in pushing for the de-industrialization of the United States.  <br/><br/>In other southern states with more advanced economies and where more black Democratic voters are employed in the tertiary sector as part of the professional managerial classes (Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia) I just don't see Sanders making large inroads with them in a bid to woo them away from Clinton. <br/><br/>Voting on the basis of hostility to the financial services industry is still a stretch for a lot of people, including African-Americans who have seen their jobs and livelihoods taken away by the vagaries of globalization and shareholder capitalism. Sanders has largely built his campaign around that very understandable theme, but the results in South Carolina are not encouraging for him.  ",

Marginal tax rates of above 60 % (Ive read figures of 67 and 72 % from Stigliitz and others as necessary to control income inequality) at the high end make sense.<br/>Just as in the first Gilded Age, the great fortunes of the second Gilded Age came as the result of government investment and government-granted monopolies.  In the first Gilded Age, it started with railroads and government land grants; in the second, it started with significant government investments in basic research in the '40's through the '60's and continued with patent-related monopolies from the '70's and '80's to the present.  While the patent system could use adjustment, a big advantage of granting monopolies is to get startups off the ground.  Of course, the monopolies lead to huge fortunes (or can lead to), so the right way to collect on government investments is through progressive taxation.  Since Reagan's presidency, the GOP has worked to shift tax burdens from the wealthy to the middle class via a series of tax cuts and subsequent readjustments.

I give Hillary a lot of credit for being such an incredibly adept liar that she has been able to propagate the image of lending a helping hand to African Americans. She was actually complicit with her husband in devastating the black community through supporting the war on drugs  and accepting campaign contributions from private prison corporations.
