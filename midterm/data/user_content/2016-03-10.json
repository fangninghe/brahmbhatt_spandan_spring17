If we finally relinquish that role we could probably cut our military expenditures by at least a half, and what the resulting billions could pay for in the civilian sector would boggle the mind! And it wouldn't hurt to return to the tax structure of the Eisenhower years, where the highest marginal rate was about 90%.  Would any of this get past congress? Of course not.

Somehow that was doable then, paid by state taxes.  Why is it impossible now?<br/><br/>As far as paying for health care, our current system, dominated by for profit insurers, is more expensive - not less - than the health care system of all other first world countries who provide universal health care.  <br/><br/>As far as the \"needed votes,\" as long as we have a Tea party/Republican dominated Congress, it is unlikely that these, or anything, will get done by ANY Democratic president.  But we can at least move the conversation to the left so the public has some sense of what is at stake that actually impacts them.",

They were sitting on their backsides complaining about how bad things were while they didn't bother voting. So the Congress flipped Republican and we get no active governance at all. So Hillary was out making a fortune speaking so she would have a lot of money to run for office, well that's just awful right? How about the fight for campaign finance reform that will help to end the influence of the very few - where have all the Bernie fans been?

Sanders still hasn't blamed Clinton for her role in accepting the Honduran military coup in 2009, and she needs to be called out on this.  Also, we cannot understand the immigration flows across our borders without understanding much of the migrant flow--especially from Central America--is a direct result of US foreign policy in the 1980s and '90s, and then let's throw  in the impact of NAFTA on Mexico.

I have no idea of the existence, let alone the validity, of the referenced poll, but if Limbaugh is right, then tonight's debate should demonstrate that a significant number of evangelicals will seriously consider Clinton and Sanders if, when appropriate, the candidates talk to evangelicals  --  not their self-appointed leaders  --  in a serious and respectful manner.",

No other democrat running for president has ever spoken at Liberty University, and Sanders delivered honesty and consistency where others fear to tread. It was not his usual stump speech - it was a remarkable attempt to establish common ground in spite of some non-negotiable differences. Anyone who thinks Sanders can't tackle gridlock should check it out. You can find the full speech on youtube. ",

They're not relevant?<br/>Bernie did not get one bill passed in his Senate career but suddenly he's going to forge alliances that never existed before? Explain how this will be achieved. If a Republicans control both chambers what will Sanders offer in return? You can't get something for nothing so what does Sanders have in his arsenal to offset that?<br/><br/>Second, concerning ISIS Sanders says that he will build a coalition using forces from countries there. But isn't it true that many of these same countries aren't committing because they do see the US as all in to defeating ISIS? How much logistical support would he give? Special forces? Continued air strikes? Where are the specifics?<br/><br/>What will Sanders do about the Iranians violating the nuclear deal  by testing ICMB's? What about Assad in Syria? China building man islands and blocking vital shipping lanes in the South China Sea  What about China placing a missile defense system they installed? <br/><br/>Tax Wall Street. And then what? Where will the capital  come from for drug companies to develop new drugs for Type 1 diabetes? Dementia? Heart diesease? Crohn's Disease? Sanders? You?<br/>How will research facilities develop new surgical techniques if the money is not there from donors who don't have the money to give? Aren't many research projects funded by Wall Street ? These people who think they are owed anything are owed nothing. I worked for what I have. So should these I am entitled spoiled brats!",

							"commentBody": "\"Maybe - maybe not?\"<br/>Socrates, as Ms. Collins says, Hillary is more capable, more effective. But she has a terrible demeanor. She comes across as too aggressive. She ought to be more deferential to Bernie. Then voters would like her &amp; won't be hesitant to vote for her, concluding that Bernie can't win in November. She has to change her style.<br/><br/>Most Democrats love Bernie. Surprisingly he is forceful &amp; articulate. He has always been sincere, which doesn't have much market value in politics. Hillary must realize that. He is more impressive than George McGovern, or Bill Clinton. I wish he tried to run a lot earlier. Now he will be 75 before the election, which is a big impediment.   ",
