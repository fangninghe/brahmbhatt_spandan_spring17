				"commentBody": "Ronald Dworkin left us with a wealth of materials that we should be using in all public schools, from the middle grades through college, not only to teach the history of Affirmative Action, but the social ethics and legal philosophical aspects of it alongside a far more robust historical curriculum than is offered in the public education. <br/><br/>The fact that we teach so little history, civics, any kind of philosophy and logic before children leave high school causes us to continue turning out a society that doesn't even question its biases when it comes to race and gender.<br/><br/>Affirmative Action is most important for its reparative aspect, not only with an eye to wrongs perpetrated in the distant past, but wrongs we perpetuate to this very day, from the allocation of resources to minority public schools, to the excuses we use to bar minority students who are as worthy as any other to participate at the higher education level, but are deemed wanting because the public education they received. That perception continues into the workplace where bias is applied, based not only based on the applicant's race, but stereotypes about the education they received. <br/><br/>These cycles of bias would be greatly attenuated if we changed radically what we teach from the lower grades in public school and encouraged vigorous debate such as this one at with Harvard's Michael Sandel. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/AUhReMT5uqA?list=PLUzL4fyKoSCsTnOmYqSho4Hf9SZA1Ucix\" title=\"https://youtu.be/AUhReMT5uqA?list=PLUzL4fyKoSCsTnOmYqSho4Hf9SZA1Ucix\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/AUhReMT5uqA?list=PLUzL4fyKoSCsTnOmYqSho4Hf9SZA1Ucix</a><br/><br/>---<br/>My essay on reparations: <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1Tb\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1Tb\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-1Tb</a>",

One of the questionable arguments presented by the Leave campaign was the view that the EU controlled the number of immigrants entering the UK,  when in fact immigration levels from non-European states which our government sets,  is higher than EU immigration. Sadly,  such incorrect rhetoric fed on peoples fears of the UK being swamped by EU citizens. It must also be made clear that members of the European Parliament are elected by EU citizens (ironically Farage is one such MEP),  so the argument that \"unaccountable bureaucrats in Brussels\" decide Britain's laws is another untrue point made by the Leave campaign. <br/><br/>Secondly, the break up of the UK will have devastating consequences, if one only refers to the political,  economic and social uncertainty it will have for years. In the case of the potential reunification of Ireland all the years of negotiating the Good Friday peace agreement between loyalists and republicans could be undone with the likely re-emergence of Unionist paramilitaries.",

				"commentBody": "We are again about to vote in a presidential election. This cycle is unlike any other in that both candidates\u2019 negative ratings are unprecedented in recent memory. In a new Gallup poll released this week, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump continue to have some strong negative perceptions among the American public across all categories except experience to be president, in which Clinton dominates.<br/><br/>Of special note in the Gallup report, is the following passage:<br/><br/>\u201cOne in three Clinton supporters say Trump is a strong and decisive leader (33%), while about three in 10 say he has the ability to stand up to special interests (30%) and can get things done (28%).\u201d<br/><br/>Given all of the poll results that are specific to voters\u2019 ratings on function, this is particularly worrisome in the event of an economic downturn or an outright recession before the November election. Voters of both candidates rate Clinton and Trump nearly equally when it comes to their ability to get things done. On getting things done, Trump wins by 2 points. On standing up to special interests, Trump bests Clinton by 8 points. On strength and decisiveness, Trump edges out Clinton by 9 points. These are hardly results one attributes to a candidate who has been discredited.<br/><br/>13 million Americans voted for Senator Sanders. How Hillary Clinton, DNC and superdelegates choose to treat the Sanders campaign at the convention in July will either motivate or dissuade progressives. <br/><br/>My full essay: <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2k4\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2k4\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2k4</a>",

These are early days and when the time approaches, no right thinking progressive will contribute to putting Trump in the White House. The percentage you cite in your article (50%) will drop to single digits. Even if it didn't, Clinton would still win. What goes unmentioned in your comment is results from that same poll show that Clinton easily bests Trump in questions of experience, judgment, managing a crisis, working with both parties, and even likability. Basic presidential material I'd say, and the American public who elected Obama twice will not veer 180 degrees to an unhinged, ill informed provocateur.",

Clinton and for Democrats.  Sanders had some good causes but did not react appropriately to Orlando and is too single focus.

The Brexit vote, largely along class lines, reflects poor fiscal and tax policies in the UK, resulting in stagnant wages and increased income inequality.  The Brexits blamed this on legal immigrants from within the European Union -- cools from Spain, carpenters from Poland.  But those workers represent a tiny fraction of the British working class and.have not depressed wages in the UK.  An inept government has.  Hopefullly the Brits will get their house in order and the block countries will learn from London's mistakes.  The effects on the US economy shiuld be nill -- the UK is not a significant trading partner of the US -- and our financial markets will rebound quickly.

				"commentBody": "Perhaps the young people who are dismayed by this result should sit back and reflect on the possible causes instead of blaming their grandparents. Those grandparents were probably born during World War II or shortly after into a world with rationing and shortages. Through hard work (and a unionised workforce) they gained meaningful jobs and a measure of prosperity and security until the 1980's and Thatcher/Reagan and trickle down, supply side hogwash. Since then it has been a slow slide downwards for the working/middle classes.<br/><br/>It is likely that a major factor in the vote to get out of Europe was a reaction against a perception that the ruling classes just do not care about ordinary people.<br/><br/>So, young people, get off your bums and spend some time with your grandparents and listen to them and try to persuade them that your vision of a modern multicultural global society is the way forward for young and old!<br/><br/>Don't be surprised if they are find automation, the sharing economy, the gig economy, a lifetime of short careers in different jobs, social media etc. a poor substitute for what they were used to before 1980. Your job is to figure out a way to convince them that the future is bright for all ages!<br/><br/>I should declare that I am 72 and was born in England and emigrated to Australia 50 years ago so I have been very fortunate in life but I still have family in the UK and most of them are grandparents. Perhaps you could talk to them!",

The financial industry will relocate somewhat to mainland Europe (or Dublin). Scotland might start down the road to independence again.  And given the new problems along the N Ireland - Free Republic border, and also given the resurgence of Ulster's businesses, I wonder if N Ireland might either wish to be independent or to be much closer to the Republic?",

With no EU, Britain was the empire where the sun never sets, and an economic giant before the World Wars, which it did not start. I think Britain will be just fine.<br/><br/>I have read the papers in England, in France, in Spain, and in Italy (though my Italian is not great). The overwhelming mood in the UK seems to be uncertainty about going it alone and the Latins seem to be between offended and diminished. Outside of the West, it isn't really top news. I don't think anybody sees this really as anything more than a fraternal feud and a kink innthe speculation markets. <br/><br/>I think this is mostly personal, not business, and that is why everyone keeps calling it a divorce.",

							"commentBody": "How condescending of you to assume every vote for leaving was caused by \"xenophobia, economic illiteracy, or nostaliga.\" I think there were plenty of Brits who had exceedingly valid reasons for voting to leave that didn't involve any of the three reasons you listed. How about autonomy to determine their own course of action without permission from the Brussels bureaucracy? The fact that their economy is one of the strongest in the EU and is used to prop up other countries - thus dragging down their own economy? Or what about the right to determine to decide who, and how many, people enter into the country? Seems to me these are reasonable concerns for any thinking person. Just because the majority of them came to a different conclusion to the one you preferred (to quote Biden), is reason to assassinate their character as you did in their post. And you can stop weeping. Britain will be just fine.",
