				"commentBody": "The top three women in college basketball start for UConn.  In reality. the available top-quality talent is quite limited, and just a few teams monopolize recruiting at that level.  This cannot be good for the game in the long run--we knew UConn was going to win it all at the beginning of the season.  Contrast with the wacky men's tournament with many upsets because talent is both more plentiful and widely distributed.<br/><br/>The real solution is growing more talent in schools so more colleges can assemble competitive teams.  Unfortunately, that emphasis will also bring with it a tendency to cut ethical corners, as happens so often in the men's game.",

Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck might be the three best players, but of those, only Stewart was among the highest ranked recruits of her year. Jefferson was a home schooled kid on an AAU team. Year after year, Notre Dame, Maryland, Stanford and Baylor have more highly acclaimed recruiting classes than UConn. Yesterday, the announcers kept lauding the four McDonalds HS All Americans on UCLA, at least until they crumbled in the second half against Tejas. No team, perhaps in NCAA history, no matter the sport or the gender, gets results closer to maximizing their potential than THIS UConn group. It starts on defense, which is where some stars take it easy. Not on UConn. Watch them dive for loose balls even up by 30 points. Watch them run the floor and box out, even though the game has been long decided. Other teams just don't do it that way. Not in basketball, not in other sports, not in the men's sports, either. This is a special group on the brink of a special achievement.",

It might happen once, with the team overrotating on defense. But consistently, as Notre Dame allowed? Never gonna happen. And THAT, is the difference between UConn and all the rest.",

				"commentBody": " Each time I watch the Maryland and South Carolina Women play, it's so obvious  how much Maryland's Brenda Frese and South Carolina's Dawn Staley's coaching styles fall short when compared to Connecticut's Geno Auriemma's.<br/><br/>Geno has has the unique ability to relate to his players (as individuals and then together as team) in a way that doesn't interfere with their learning curve but instead enriches it. This is his genius. <br/><br/>I don't get that sense with Dawn Staley and Brenda Frese. Dawn Staley's players appear to play scared, always anticipating being berated when they don't do something right, casting their eyes to the bench to grade Staley's level of disapproval. <br/><br/>And I can't imagine that frantic running around thing Brenda Frese does for so much of the game, how disruptive it must be to Maryland's players as they attempt to establish a flow to their game  All that yelling she does, instructions or whatever can't instill too much confidence in her players, as if they can't figure things out on their own. <br/><br/>Geno will yell in a play, maybe get a player attention's that's close at hand, but seldom show any uncontrolled outbursts like Staley and Frese are guilty of. You just get that feeling he's always in control. Yeah, he may be exploding inside at times, but he won't let his team see it, unless of course he believes it could be a 'teaching moment.' Jerking out your starters without saying a word? Priceless. And shows his Genius. ",

In fact, in 21 years, there have been about six ultra top players who came through: Rebecca Lobo, Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi, Maya Moore, Tina Charles and Breanna Stewart.<br/>The rest are good to excellent prospects who become great because they went to UConn.<br/>At the start of every season, talk of how great the recruiting classes are at Maryland, South Carolina, Baylor, Notre Dame and Stanford. Geno adds one brick at a time. And yesterday, the announcers were getting damp over UCLAs four HS All Americans, until they blew the lead in the second half to Tejas.<br/><br/>Watch Stanford upset Notre Dame. ND kept letting Stanford's Samuelson get open in the corner for uncontested threes, a bunch of which she made, and it got Stanford across the line. You can bet your house that an Auriemma team wouldn't let that happen. And today, after using the same spot to hit big shots against Maryland and Kentucky, Stanford let Oshahor spot up for three point set shots(!), wide open. You can bet if Washington faces UConn in the final, that shot will NOT be open. Auriemma, Dailey and the staff are meticulous in scouting, defensive game planning, and making sure the team executes the best defense in the land. Failing to play best case defense is what sent South Carolina, Notre Dame and Stanford packing.  ",

In a general election match-up between Trump and Clinton, women will vote in a landslide for Hillary, especially when his misogynist comments are played over and over again in Democratic ads. <br/><br/>There were already rumblings of this in the March 15th voting.<br/><br/>Trump has not been vetted yet, politically, the way Clinton has. It is still early and  many women (and men) have not yet given careful attention to the candidates. When they do, and realize just how anti-feminist Trump is, all hell will break lose.<br/><br/>Generational and partisan differences among women will disappear in their concerted effort to beat Trump.

For years, the media has supported policies that have hurt the middle class while benefiting a wealthy corporate elite. The media promoted the wonders of free trade and globalization, claiming it would make everybody richer and that nothing could be done to stop it.  The media blamed the ever growing trade deficit on incompetent  American workers, who were allegedly incapable of producing anything the world wanted to buy. <br/><br/>The media lauded the hard work and entrepreneurship of immigrants, while subtly implying that native born Americans were lazy and stupid. The media  talked up the benefits of mass immigration, even of the illegal variety.<br/><br/>And the media succeeded in serving the interests of their true masters. Corporations and the wealthy have reaped most of the gains from technological progress. Mass immigration and free trade have held down labor costs. <br/><br/>And now the middle class has had enough. Faced with a declining standard of living, people are voting for the candidate who sounds most serious about fixing the southern border and balancing trade flows. Not surprisingly, the media is horrified. ",
