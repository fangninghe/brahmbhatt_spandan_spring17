				"commentBody": "Facing protests and outcry over the name in 1995, Cleveland issued a press release that referred to Sockalexis as the true source of the name.<br/>According to Joe Posnanski, a sportswriter for NBC Sports, the Indians name was chosen by sportswriters from the four city newspaper at the request of then-team owner Charles Somers. Posnanski writes they chose the name because the Boston Braves had a dynamite season the year before and it was \u201ca glorious opportunity for\u2026Native American jokes and race-specific clich\u00e9s and insults that fit well in headlines.\u201d<br/>Posnanski wrote there was never any mention of Sockalexis.<br/>Chris Sockalexis said his family has always stood against the Chief Wahoo logo.<br/>\u201cI guess first and foremost they should lose the logo,\u201d he said. \u201cIndians is still a stereotypical name, but it\u2019s better than Redskins (the Washington NFL football team), so I\u2019m not totally offended by the name Indians, just the logo.\u201d<br/>When he started playing, Louise Sockalexis was called a \u201cwonder\u201d by former New York Giants manager John Ward, who had seen him play in college, according to the Society for American Baseball Research. In his first 20 major league games Sockalexis hit with an average of .372, according to the society.<br/>Sockalexis also faced racial taunts from fans during games.",

My dad lost weight throughout the school year and it was everything my mom could do to get him to gain it back during the short summer break.

Supporting Trump is only the latest evidence that evangelical Christianity has moved so far from the teachings of Jesus that I am not sure it should be considered Christian at all.

Americans who come from a Christian background but who believe in the Constitution and humanistic traditions that have made the United States such a great nation, are rejecting their own religious tradition because they are uncomfortable being associated with a religion that has been so closely tied to the Republican party and all of its evils.",

				"commentBody": "Nicholas, you write: \"It is too often acceptable on liberal campuses to create a climate hostile and contemptuous of evangelicals \u2014 and that, too, is bigotry\". <br/><br/>That hostility you see is not likely due to bigotry, defined as intolerance toward those who hold different opinions from oneself, but contempt for flaming hypocrisy, ie. claiming to be \"pro-life\" when in fact you are merely pro-birth (once a child is born it is more often than not, considered an onerous burden on society). Just one example of many that come quickly to mind.<br/><br/>How many of those who feel hostility towards evangelicals feel any hostility towards the Amish, even though that demographic might be as far or even more removed from their belief systems as evangelicals. <br/><br/>That would be because the Amish live their religion quietly amongst themselves and do not foist their beliefs on the secular world. They apparently don't bash anyone for what they must certainly see as 'sins' because clearly those sins don't affect their personal relationship to God. Just the way it should be. <br/><br/>The world\u2014as far as I can tell\u2014respects them and leaves them to worship as they wish. There are no doubt isolated exceptions to this but not many. <br/><br/>Evangelicals could benefit from the humility and honesty of the Amish. Respect is earned by giving it sincerely, not demanding it with empty sanctity like so many of the utterly phony evangelicals who regularly make a great show of their twisted interpretations of Christianity.",

People who actually know something? Even if you take away all the nastiness of Trump's campaign, what is left is someone who has absolutely no clue what he is talking about. Just look at any of his \"policy\" speeches, even the ones on teleprompter, and you are confronted with pure gibberish. Is that the alternative to \"the elites\" which Douthat would have us entrust the future of the US and the world to?<br/><br/>His \"policy speech\" this morning about what he \"pledges\" to do in the first 100 days, at least the part before he got back into his personal grievances, was one of the few speeches which actually sounded like a sane political campaign speech. But even here, on closer inspection, the \"policies\" don't add up. <br/><br/>His \"senior advisors\" - Steve Bannon, Roger Ailes and the once respectable, but now virtually demented Giuliani, are about as far away from being \"policy elite\" as one can get. Are these the kind of people that Douthat would entrust out future to?<br/><br/>The true \"policy elites\" with whom everyone is fed up are the members of the GOP in Congress who eight years ago declared as their highest objective to \"make Obama fail\". To that end they have shut down the government twice, threatened to do it several more times, and have voted some 60 off times to repeal ObamaCare.",

On health care United Heath and Anthem have reported record profits in the most recent quarter as our co pays and RX costs spiral out of reach and the care worsens and the S.S. system some of us have paid Twelve percent of our life's earnings into for (in my case sixty plus years) is losing its purchasing power out due to the lies that there is little inflation, perpetrated on both sides of the aisle.

It is a shameful example of unscientific terminology chosen to advance a preferred policy option. <br/><br/>Do you really think there is \"the possibility that the ocean pH could be driven below 7.0 if the CO2 partial pressure goes high enough\"?<br/><br/>I challenge you to share with us your calculations on just what that CO2 partial pressure would be, how much hydrocarbons would have to be burned to get to pH 7.0, where we would get that much hydrocarbons, and how long it would take at the rates of hydrocarbon consumption projected for the foreseeable future.   <br/><br/>According to the NOAA, the answer is that ocean pH will NEVER go below 7.0. <br/><br/>Can you demonstrate that the NOAA is wrong?
