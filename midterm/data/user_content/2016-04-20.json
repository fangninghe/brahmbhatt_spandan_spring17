I know that Sanders (and probably many of his supporters\" deem these issues as \"distractions,\" but they are critically important to me.  We have a Supreme Court vacancy and a Roe v.

In fact, I think Mr. Liang would have been given the benefit of the doubt often given to cops were Mr. Gurley white but that, in the current climate, Mr. Liang was more likely to be charged because Mr. Gurley was black.  This is not to say whether he should have been charged or not.  It is to say that there might have been some mixed motives in charging him--conscious or unconscious and unintentional.  <br/><br/>Mr. Thompson was operating in the context of a grand jury that did not indict Mr. Pantaleo for causing a death that he could have prevented.  Darren Wildon was not indicted for a death that some believe he unjustifiably caused.  Mr. Liang was low-hanging fruit. <br/><br/> I much doubt, or at least hope not, that Mr. Thompson was more likely to charge Liang because he is Asian.  But he or a white officer may, but hopefully not, have been more likely to have been charged than a black officer.  Mr. Thompson was truly operating in a very difficult context.

But Mr. Sanders has lately morphed into a person unrecognizable from  the person I first met in this campaign. <br/><br/>His discovery that New York ran a closed primary. which he and his team should have known as professional campaigners, is now to blame the Democrats, causing his young supporters to call the game 'rigged', and alienate them from the party. He further says that 3million independent voters are disenfranchised because of these rules. Bernie Sanders has under his charge millions of young voters - he has, imo, a responsibility to instill in them fair play and to accept rules and regulations, not to incite them otherwise. They are understandably disappointed and furious - that's where their mentor  should have stepped in. His campaign team should have looked into various eligibility questions for all the primary/caucus states.<br/><br/>Bernie has indeed raised the consciousness of many - although the inequality bit has been with us for years. Still, that was his campaign and it was effective. But his my way or my way style is dogmatic and wearying. If he still sees a way forward, he should continue. But if he finds a way to remain relevant, help his adopted party and the country move forward, and continue to inspire his followers, even better.",
