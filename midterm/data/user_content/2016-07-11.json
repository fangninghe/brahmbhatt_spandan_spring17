				"commentBody": "The best thing any organization can do is assume that *someone* will be tempted to steal, given the opportunity. Proactively reducing opportunities for theft is far better than decrying modern moral decay afterward.  Dividing up financial duties and oversight is a good start.  <br/><br/>If theft is immoral, then so is creating the lure to steal by setting out piles of money with a sign effectively saying, \"No one will notice if you steal this, but please don't.\"  The simple truth of human nature is that most people have some vulnerability to stealing, given the right mix of character and situation.  You can't tell by looking at them -- maybe not even by looking in the mirror.<br/><br/>I think this article demonstrates convincingly that if corporations are indeed people, then they surely need the same scrupulous external oversight and penalties to reduce their potential to cheat the society around them.  A self-regulating market is as naive as the dream of true communism.  Only a robust, regulated government vying on equal terms with a robust, regulated market can neutalize each other's intrinsic human flaws.",

Some will blame Barack Obama. <br/><br/>The American apple-pie 1950s were during the worst years of the Communist fears. It must be the Communists. Some now blame the NRA.<br/><br/>Sounds simple to me, its the overhyped greed of the pure capitalists who have tried to eliminate all regulatory agencies so they can continue to ransack the economy and the American people.

Statements as candidate seeking votes carry little weight, but her echoing Pres. Obama on the Pivot to Asia will be critical. The American links to Asia heavily Military China\u2019s heavily Economic the resulting scenario dangerous. <br/><br/>Does the world need a Cold-War-II? Winston Churchill once advised that it is always better to \u201cjaw-jaw\u201d than to \u201cwar-war,\u201d meaning diplomacy is preferable to conflict. Hopefully HRC is of that school, but that may be debatable.<br/>The problem being China difficult to frighten and like America in an assertive mood.",

These brave \"armed citizens\", who thought it a good idea to come armed to a civil rights demonstration over people getting shot, are fortunate that they themselves were not shot.<br/><br/>NRA propaganda tells us that in the event of a mass shooter, having \"good guys with guns\" will neutralize the bad guy with a gun.  On that theory, all of these brave armed citizens should have run toward the gunfire, taken up positions, and returned the fire  Instead, they pretty much all ran away from the gunfire.   So much for the NRA fairy tales.   All these brave armed citizens accomplished was distraction of already highly stressed police forces.",
