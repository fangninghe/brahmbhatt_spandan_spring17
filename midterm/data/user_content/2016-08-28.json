							"commentBody": "Montreal Moe,<br/><br/>As I see it, the only valid argument for cheerleading for capitalism is that it has been a very productive form of economic social organisation. Even though there has been such misery along with the productivity, one could really be sincere in their belief about what capitalism has accomplished. <br/><br/>On the other hand, it does seem that the productivity and value added from labor is declining fast. Economists like Yanis Varoufakis, Michael Hudson and others have pointed out that today's low growth world really started in the 70's with the end of Bretton Woods. Financialization put off until now, perhaps, what we are experiencing due to the end of the credit bubble from housing.<br/><br/>It really does seem like we are long overdue for a revolution. I just hope it's one where people will free themselves from unnecessary work, and instead enjoy life and friendship. <br/><br/>There are so many very serious people who think that our neo-classical economics is a blue print from god, or illustration of Darwin's evolution. This kind of fatalism and prideful certainty is what one would expect from a 19th century Victorian, not a 21st century person. What a strange world. <br/><br/>Oh well, just wanted to say hello.",

Israel\u2019s self-interest in keeping from being pushed into the sea, and the Arabs\u2019 shared interest in using Israel as a bloody shirt to keep their people distracted from too few average daily calories and pronounced oppression seem too opposed on casual analysis to be bridgeable.<br/><br/>But on more than that casual analysis, it becomes evident that the two sides CAN be allies if not \u201cfriends\u201d. They DO share at least two basic interests, which are mutual distrust of Iran and a desire for regional stability. I\u2019d like to think that Obama and Kerry are sufficiently Machiavellian to have foreseen this possible outcome and trucked with Iran and blown it so badly in Syria for precisely this purpose \u2013 driving the two sides into one another\u2019s arms with no need by the U.S. to actually pay for it \u2013 but frankly I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re that bright.<br/><br/>The NEXT salient question is if Israel and the Arab states DO get into bed together seriously, will the resulting shared interests align with ours in the region?

The U.S. has troops in Syria opposing interests of the Syrian Government, Turkey, Russia, Iran and Israel. Also after paying off Iran ($1.6 Billion) the U.S. has warships firing warning shots at Iranian warships while sending fighter aircraft into Syrian airspace to stop Syrian Government warplanes from bombing rebels operating on Syrian soil.<br/><br/>Russia has ground and air forces in Syria fighting for the Syrian government that has killed a few hundred thousand of its own citizens as well as displacing millions more.<br/><br/>Turkey has ground and air forces in Syria supporting some rebels fighting ISIS while attacking Kurdish Rebels that are also fighting the Syrian Government and ISIS. Turkey \"unofficially\" is buying oil from ISIS at the same time!<br/><br/>Iran has ground forces in Syria fighting on behalf of the Syrian Government. <br/><br/>Israel is fighting Iran and Herbal in Syria and likely supporting some of the rebels.<br/><br/>The U.S., Russia, and Israel have nuclear weapons as do Britain and France who also have forces in Syria.<br/><br/>What could possibly go wrong here?

She has spent good chunks of her career trying to help children. Her values are right. She hasn't simply talked about helping children, she's done work to do it. She wants to tax wealthy people. She believes in science. She supports a woman's right to choose.<br/>And yet, you go on and on and on about the stupid, relatively unimportant things, and charges that are hyped up by her political enemies, and cast her as a shifty, untrustworthy person.<br/>George Washington stood by Hamilton for his whole Presidency and valued his arguments despite attempts by Thomas Jefferson to sabotage him at every turn.<br/>She is not perfect - nobody is. But you read WAY too much into certain things being a reflection of her character and are incapable of giving her the benefit of the doubt.",

All issues are minutely examined under microscope over and over- no need for HC to comment. Why? So far no scandals- just a hope for one... Why are we rooting for a scandal? Why do we want to believe there are evil intentions and hidden agendas behind a lifetime of public service? And as for speaking publicly on issues and platforms, what is it you want to know that you don't already know at this point in the campaign? Have you visited the candidate's website? Did you miss the Convention? Where have you been for the last 25 years?",

Hamilton's Federalists were the ideological ancestors of today's Republican Party -- or, I should say, of yesterday's Republican Party, the one run by Wall Street and its allies rather than by right-wing radio.  But yesterday's Republicans are today's Democrats, and no Democrat is more Republican than Hillary Clinton.  Whoever wins in November, Americans are in for a bad ride.

One of the most famous moments in the history of the sport is a flagrant intentional hand ball allowing a 5'6\" attacker to get to a high ball over a 6'4\" goalkeeper, and then smugly saying after the match that the goal was scored \"by the hand of god.\" Did you complain about the Dutch dirty tactics, including Nigel de Jong cleating Xabi Alonso in the chest, sullying the 2010 WC Final? I could go on for hours, having been a fan for 40 years. I think you should familiarize yourself with the history of the game before you try to sell fair play and winning or losing in the right way. I was in Spain for the 1982 WC, not in Gijon on site, when West Germany and Austria fixed a match that allowed both to advance at the expense of Algeria. Later in that tournament, West German Harald Schumacher almost killed France's Patrick Battiston with one of the most violent challenges I have ever seen. Not only not a red card, but not even called a foul. Please, Chris, you're talking about a sport ruled by FIFA, for goodness' sake. Winning or losing the right way...what a laugh.",
