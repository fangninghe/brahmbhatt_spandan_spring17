Donald Trump better deliver, other wise, there will be a real disillusionment even further.  He was the wrong messenger but he touched on issues that people care about.  Hillary Clinton did not have a platform other than giving everything away free, more taxes, that is not a way to go forward, but does Donald Trump have any idea about fiscal honesty and discipline, time will tell.  The American public will all be paying attention.",

Even if Ms. Clinton wins (barely) there is no prospect that she will be able to govern --- since the willingness of at least half (or more) of the country to elect as the most powerful person in the world a thin-skinned narcissist whose main qualification is arrogant ignorance will not abate in either case. Global warming will be neglected (or worse, abetted); the world economy will stagger and may well fall into the Depression we avoided in 2008. of course, many of those who gleefully voted for the nihilism  that is Trumpism will be caught in the disaster, but will blame it on the rest of us. And we will all eventually be caught as well.<br/><br/>The feeling I am waging a losing battle against has been growing for some time: that perhaps the political philosophers of antiquity were right, that the \"demos\" in \"democracy\" is really a mob, that our experiment in self-rule has failed --- which would be just given that our Original Sin of black slavery (the parent of our endemic racism) has never been expiated.      <br/><br/>I will probably be all right, as I am approaching 80, have enough to live in modest comfort,  and will not live long enough to see the worst of it.

Well, I have two opinions to voice on that issue, and they apply equally to those in a similar position in the US.<br/><br/>1. It is highly likely that manufacturing in the UK (and the US) will experience a resurgence.<br/>2. The factories driving this growth will have little or no need for those poorly educated men and women, of whatever race, in the future. The majority of openings will be for those who can apply their learning to creating competitive advantage for their companies.<br/><br/>I have just re-iterated to a colleague of mine that the culture of entitlement really does exist, but it's not to be found primarily among young, supposedly lazy millennials; it exists in the minds of the working class in industrial countries who have for too long believed that they're owed a living because of where they were born.",
