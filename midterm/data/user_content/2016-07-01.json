I'm afraid of looming anti-LBGTQ violence, the hatred which you and I know better than most. I'm also afraid that Exceptionalism is corrupting decent Americans into believing lies about millions of refugees worldwide, who are fleeing unimaginable torture and destruction. I'm afraid of losing the true nature of the generous, welcoming American spirit - to a xenophobic meanness and embarrassing ignorance of world affairs. I'm afraid that partisanship will destroy any actual chance of our nation implementing a practical combination of rigorous background screening with the courage to deeply care about decent human beings from halfway around the world, suffering from policies in which the U.S. has had a formidable hand. And I'm afraid that Conservatives will read this piece, these comments - and either ignore their own withering human interconnectedness - or get even angrier and cold-hearted (read: full of fear of The Other, be it you and I as gay men, or desperate refugees of color) than they are now.",

Yes, there was racism and intolerance, but not on the scale you suggest. Freedom of religion has been guaranteed in the Syrian constitution for over 50 years, and homosexuality, while definitely not as accepted as it is in the west, was generally tolerated so long as you didn't get politically active about it. So no, there weren't pride parades, but many gay men were able to be out with their friends and families without fear of reprisal.<br/>If suddenly the Syrian refugees somehow had full political control, as you fear, they would not take our country back to the dark ages...in fact you'd probably be safer here than in some of the southern States.",

				"commentBody": "The refugees are screened by the UN when they first get to the camps, then they wait for years to be admitted to a country for resettlement. Yes, health needs are a factor, but when you've been living in the camp for years, (or outside working under the table, if you can find a job), you're at the top of the list for medical needs too.  ISIL hasn't sent agents to infiltrate the refugees that were settled under this new campaign, this group left Syria and came to the camps during the civil war before ISIL got involved. Yes, ISIL agents that came into the camps a year or two ago could still be there and on the list for resettlement, but they won't be resettled for at least another year or two...in other words it's safer to take them now, then later. Now, they could get radicalized while in the camp, but that just gives more impetus for the need to not only get them out and settled somewhere that they can actually have a chance at a better life, but to get the camps the aid they so desperately need, which lowers the chances of desperate people succumbing to their persuasions.",
