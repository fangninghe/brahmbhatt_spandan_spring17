Certainly, Republicans, who were already prepared to treat her Presidency as illegitimate (as they have with Obama, despite his having won overwhelming popular and electoral victories). Forget impeachment - they would maintain that she should not be allowed to take the oath of office in the first place. Now, imagine what their reactions will be like if Trump wins the electoral college but looses the popular vote. Bet it would be quite a contrast.",

The blood of anti-war protesters eventually flowed on US campuses while Richard Nixon's supporters cheered when they received word of the carnage.<br/><br/>Then, of course, we have the much earlier and much more dramatic example of America's bloodiest war: the Civil War. Quite close to where I live are the remains of the defensive earthworks known as Fort Stevens, one of the fortified positions that were created early in the conflict to keep Southern armies from entering Washington and burning it to the ground. <br/><br/>It was at Fort Stevens on July 11-12, 1864, that President Lincoln watched as Union troops repulsed the last Confederate invasion of the North.<br/><br/>The chances that any violence in the wake of the present election could match that which followed the election of Abraham Lincoln are almost infinitely small, but I would not be surprised if the blood shed after months of Trump's incitements to brutal deeds exceeded that of the Vietnam era.<br/><br/>Words are strange that way. If you charge them with hatred and use them often enough, they might as well be weapons firing off fatal projectiles. We shall soon see what Trump's wicked rhetoric has wrought, but we will never allow his attack on Americanism to succeed.",

I still am- and can't imagine what the gov would be like under a Trump victory. With Donald, If the Rep maintain the House and Senate, they might get things done-- but Donald is not too popular with them; if the Dem get control even of one house, things will stall. If Hillary wins and the Dems get control of Congress things will get done, but if the Reps control one house, things stall. We all get the picture.<br/><br/>Over the course of the year, I feel as though I've been continually beaten. The vitriol and hate is overwhelming. Whereas I couldn't wait for Election Day to come, I now fear it as much as I want this to end.The hate and nastiness looms and feels like it will never end. Of course being a Dem, I feel so much coming from the other side- which I'm sure many on the other side would say about the Dems. The threat of violence and Donald's refusal to say IF he will accept the results (if it goes against him) just fuels the flames. We need to get past this.<br/><br/>We need a working Congress and a President who will work across the aisles, not leaders who threaten annihilation or stalemates.<br/><br/>Nov. 8 will be very anxiety provoking- maybe I'll watch The Walking Dead.",

How any decent person can justify his rants I will never understand.<br/>The republicans began their smear campaign against Hillary several years ago and literally brainwashed millions with false information.  If the republicans had found anything on Hillary over that time do you think they would have just let her walk?  Hearing after hearing; deposition after deposition; it was unending.  The Clintons are smart but no one is perfect.  If there was a smoking gun it would have been found.  Just like the null result with Whitewater...after wasting 50 mill. Taxpayer dollars all they found was that a man lied about having an affair...under oath.  What a Shakespearian tragedy!  No man has ever stooped that low!

We have at our fingertips literally the knowledge of all the great libraries of the world. My concern is what we do with this vast array.  <br/><br/>Were I to go back in time, armed with all I now know about JFK and Nixon, how might I react? How would all this newly acquired knowledge affect my thinking? Neither would measure up well in my estimation. Too much information about things that are not important clogs up the brain pan, interfere with one's analytical processes. How can I vote for JFK, now that Wikileaks shows evidence of his many extramarital indiscretions? Nixon seldom sleeps with his wife let alone go catting around with some floozies. Could he be the one?<br/><br/>I wonder, is that what matters? I'm a liberal who believes in principles Senator Kennedy (Kids, he was a liberal) is espousing. I go on believing such, thus voting for LBJ, HHH, McGovern, Carter, Mondale, Dukakis, Clinton, Gore, Kerry, Obama, and H. Clinton. <br/><br/>When it comes to politics I have long ago resigned myself to acknowledging that I am closed-minded. I continue to profess the beliefs of the Democratic Party. All the white noise which emanates from the mass media distorts more than it enlightens. I watch in amusement, and I ignore most of it.

They are afraid that if they tell the pollster they are for Trump, the pollster will conclude they are bigots.  Some whites are afraid that the pollster will retaliate against them.  This might sound paranoid, but believe me:  Many people are very afraid.<br/><br/>Cases In Point:  In 1989, the Democratic candidate in the Virginia Governor's race, Doug Wilder, was black.  Polls said he was about 18 points ahead.  He won, but he won by a sliver.  Some whites, I think, thought pollsters would think they were anti-black if they said they liked the Republican.  <br/><br/>In 1989, and in 1993, Dinkins (black) contested Guilini (white) in the New York's Mayoral race.  In both races Dinkins' numbers in the polls were better than his numbers on election day.  (Incidentally, in 89, Dinkins won; in 93, Guiliani won.)  <br/><br/>Of course, Hillary is not black.  But Trump is identified with racism and Hillary has clung to Obama throughout this campaign.  <br/><br/>Obama has gone to North Carolina on several occasions to boost Clinton's black vote.  I wonder how many whites resent this and feel more compelled to vote for Trump.",

Although that's certainly a factor, the deeper truth is that so many among us are Trumpian at heart:  bigoted, ignorant and proud of it.  If Bernie or anyone else were the Democratic nominee, the GOP playbook would still be the same: character assassination, Trumped-up charges, innuendo, vilification, threats of impeachment, email hacks, dog whistles, scare tactics, intimations of violence, voter intimidation, promises to paralyze government. None of this will change on November 9th. November 8th isn't the end; it's the horrible beginning and we have the GOP to thank.",

I would make one correction: Although the GOP is a factor, there is one clear and undeniable reality: The population of the United States is extremely stupid. Pull no punches, people, americans are very very very stupid. Nobody with half a brain could possibly buy the Trump nonsense and ignore the fact that he is a horrible human being. The chickens have come home to roost, and there is a price to pay, no matter who wins the election. It is a Nation of Nitwits.",

							"commentBody": "\"Bigoted, ignorant, and proud of it.\" This is the 2016 election. I have posted comments to this newspaper, the WaPo, and spoken with acquaintances. I have scoffed that people do not read books. They not only do not care, they are proud of it. I have mentioned a lack of education; \"Advanced degrees (even an undergraduate degree) are for 'elites'\", they reply. Fact remains, many people still cannot fathom a Harvard educated black man. Really. Even though that was an eight year ago topic. The basket of deploables is a shrinking demographic. But it exists. The media is not blameless. But until recently they did not label lies as lies.<br/><br/>I heard Trump read from the Brietbart teleprompter just last night. Lie after lie. Yet CNN, MSNBC and others played it as if it were normal. The Earth is actually older than 7000 years or so. Clinton Cash is not a book. Science is not evil. The bad news, and sadly I do not have a solution, is that deplorables (like your fellow breakfast patron) only converse with other deplorables in person, on Facebook, and on their ever present phones.<br/><br/>I used to go to Starbucks and people were reading, or had laptops open, or were studying. Now they are texting. Alas, they are texting others who do not challenge them.",

				"commentBody": "This summer my family and I attended a Lakewood (New Jersey) Blue Claws game and sat in outdoor skybox seats behind and to the right of home plate. We were above the net that provided some protection to the fans in the seats below, from the front but not from overhead. I admonished my six-year-old son to pay attention at all times and I did the same. A foul ball hit the box next to us hard. Maybe a dozen went over the net and smacked into the concession area where hundreds of people were walking and dozens worked, and they would surely not be watching the game - only luck kept them safe. In one instance a fouled back ball went over the net, hit the stadium wall and bounced back into the seats below, hitting a young child in the back of the head. He and his distraught mother were escorted out. I spent so much time being super-vigilant and my son was so worried that it took most of the enjoyment out of the day. He has no desire to go to another baseball game and I won't be taking him.",

In this case, there is nothing to replace it with except Trump and Putin, not USA and Russia leading to a new social contract, but Trump and Putin.  Perhaps Mr. Trump fantasizes himself and Pres. Putin as something out of the old WCW/WWE story line.  If that's the case, then this is further evidence that he and his core supporters can't see the difference between fiction and reality.  This is the real world you are staging your melodrama in, Mr. Trump. The set is earth and the actors whose fate you alone want to decide, everyone on it.  To view the presidency as a position of such power is not consistent with our long-held ideals.  To take such a responsibility frivolously and selfishly, as you do, is an act of infamy, even if you lose and never see the inside of the White House again.",
