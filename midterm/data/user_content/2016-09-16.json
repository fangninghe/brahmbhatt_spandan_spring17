There is \"Fastest\", \"Latest\", and \"First\".<br/><br/>I thought that May puzzle was significantly crueler than the December (which was just death by rebus when you look back at it). The revealer in the May puzzle was at best barely adequate to tell the solver that there are characters outside the grid, the fact that they were the same letters every time was not indicated at all, and we didn't even get the benefit of asterisks so we'd know which entries were involved.",

Bernies supporters weren't just the young privileged white men they were and still are made out to be -- by the MSM and the DNC / Clinton machine.  The first thing HRC did after \"winning\" the nomination from Bernie was appoint Debbie Wasserman-Schultz her campaign chair, make it clear she would not consider Bernie for VP, and pick TPP Kaine for her VP.  Not a word about the thing that animated the millions of Bernie supporters (and may just be at the root of much of the angst of the \"deplorables\" she dismisses, like Marie Antoinette):  growing inequality under the creeping oligarchy of the past 40 years -- because she's at the center of it.  No thanks.  I don't vote for Republicans.",
