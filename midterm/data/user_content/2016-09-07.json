It doesn't sound right.  In fact, it seems quite illegal, yet since it is Mr. Trump, nothing will happen.  This story will blow by like all the other stories of his corruption and law-breaking.  It is breathtaking to see what Mr. Trump has done and know that he can continue to operate normally as a candidate.",

The Clinton Foundation has helped many millions receive HIV medicine and malaria medicine, saving lives.  It spends 88% of its funding in its entities on charity.  It is a public charity that divulges all donors.<br/><br/>I really wish Trump supporters would stay moored in reality for at least a minute or two.  Trump got away with openly bribing the attorney generals of both Florida and Texas to drop their investigations of the Trump U fraud.  The Texas case was well along when Greg Abbott had the staff drop it after receiving $35,000.<br/><br/>The New York Times has absolutely disgraced itself with its coverage of the right wing smear job about both the Clinton emails and the Clinton Foundation as well as about Bill Clinton's trip to North Korea to rescue American prisoners.  There are higher journalistic standards that should be met.  Time reveals truth but if Trump is elected in the meantime, a large part of the blame rests on the timid coverage of Trump's crimes by the New York Times and other media, by the FBI and by Congress.  The double standard is sickening.",

Never admit that you did anything wrong, even if you did. And never admit that you were in the wrong even if you were. Which is why Trump fils behaves with such snarling arrogance and indifference to the truth that some misguided Americans somehow confuse with strength-of-character.<br/><br/>As the Watergate Scandal was heating up President Nixon grandly proclaimed that he was above the law. He didn't say it in the first person, but the third. \"The President is above the law\". Not just like a king, but an absolute monarch. The U.S. Constitution didn't apply to the President.<br/><br/>A vote for Trump would be a vote for Nixon's theory of the Office of President.<br/><br/>A vote for Trump would be cast for a corrupt, corrupting, corrupted tyrant; with all that implies.",

That the truth is what you say it is.<br/><br/>Cohn unleashed Trump's worst impulses by showing him how to use the law and our flawed legal system to evade any consequences. He probably taught him the finer points of chess, looking five, eight moves ahead, planning the rip-off from the first friendly encounter to \"you're fired\".<br/><br/>Seduce the mark. Lure him closer until he's in striking distance while testing him, quietly studying his weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Use that to maneuver (aka: \"negotiate\") him into a vulnerable position, even a kill box. Manipulate him into signing a one-sided contract. Then, slowly rip him off for everything you can get. Finally, dump a ton of abuse on him, blame him for everything that happened and discard him, leaving him face down in the gutter. Then, on to the next one.<br/><br/>\"Pump and dump Trump\". <br/><br/>More lessons. A few small crimes might trip you up but an onslaught of them, a tsunami, a way of life built around them warps the surrounding environment. That normalizes otherwise outrageous misbehavior, makes it acceptable.<br/><br/>Should others object or fail to acquiesce, bully them into silence, into acquiescing. Bend them to your will. Force them to accept it, and you, for what you are.<br/><br/>Attract like-minded people into your orbit. Uses them as long as it profits you, then discard them too.",
