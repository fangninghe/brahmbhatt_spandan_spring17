We're never going to use these things, for if we ever did nothing would matter anymore anyway afterwards, so what's all the uproar?  Maybe the only realistic good these weapons have is the talk of them since using the actual thing is a moot point.  Talking only about it is kind of the equivalent of that neutron bomb that was talked about years ago, but never built.  The one that was supposed to destroy everything while leaving everything still standing.  Who'd of known Trump was a nuclear scientist?",

Worst-case scenario, the Senate brings a lawsuit and the Supreme Court decides the president cannot act without the Senate's consent.  Even then, the Supreme Court would likely clarify the parameters of \"consent,\" so there would be precedent for the future.  So, there's no harm to making the attempt, Mr. President, other than maybe some egg on your face, and possibly a lot of good can come from it.",

But I'm afraid I cannot see how enhanced nuclear capability is even remotely applicable in any of the tragedies Conway cited as impetus for Trump's ludicrously dangerous comments. This man is a desperate hazard on every level, and yet his supporters continue to ignore the roll call of danger signs while concurrently claiming that Trump has a mandate -- despite losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million. I don't know about the rest of you, but I become absolutely vomitous every time one of these idiot Trump spokespersons starts talking about voter fraud and the millions in hypothetical support that he could have easily tapped into had the popular vote been Trump's goal, rather than winning the third smallest Electoral margin of all time.
