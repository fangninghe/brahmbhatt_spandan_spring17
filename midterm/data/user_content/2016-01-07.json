And then he simply repeated your observations -- we need balanced budgets. Kasich was patronizing and cowardly. And left me thinking he doesn't have a clue what to do. <br/><br/>How, Mr. Kasich, are we going to \"balance budgets, lower taxes,\" and \"plug together to fix our schools?\" You aren't exactly showing us how its done there in Ohio.  And spare us the hand on the shoulder and the mussing of our hair while you wink at us and declare, \"I love idealistic young people! Keep trying and never give up.\"  What a load. ",

His life was work every day and the Mets on the radio and then on TV whenever possible. When they won the Series in 1969, he came home with turf from Shea, we never forgot how happy he was. He died in 1996, and we kept going to Shea to carry on his legacy as a fan. So we were honored to be there to see Mike Piazza play, and the thrill of that will stay with us for our lifetimes.  We will never forget the first game at Shea after 9/11, when we needed hope, Mike was there. We miss so many good things - we miss Dad, we miss Shea, we miss watching Mike play - and we are so happy to see a true gentleman and great player get into the Hall today. Thank you, Mr. Piazza - and many congratulations on this well deserved honor. Know that you make all Mets fans, the ones here and the ones in the Shea in the Sky, very happy today and always. When you go to Cooperstown, we'll follow you there to see your plaque - you will be the reason we go there. That's how much you mean to us. ",
