				"commentBody": "Mark Thomasen, I have seen a few gleams of light from you lately, and want to acknowledge them. I will continue to push against simplistic characterizations and the monolithic social media distortions coming not only from the right but from the left, but I do acknowledge that you are a thoughtful person. It's tempting, and I do fall, to oversimplify. I am desperately afraid of what all the buyers-in to the purity monster have condemned us to. I know more about climate than most, and these guys are monstrous. Sessions, who is \"offended\" by climate science.<br/><br/>Have a look at the program our colleague Russell Seitz exposed in his usual humorous way. If that list doesn't give you a cauld grue, it's because you haven't become acquainted with the black is white crowd of tobacco-trained Koch-infested climate science denial.<br/><a href=\"https://vvattsupwiththat.blogspot.com/2016/12/weve-got-to-back-up-our-science-with.html\" title=\"https://vvattsupwiththat.blogspot.com/2016/12/weve-got-to-back-up-our-science-with.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://vvattsupwiththat.blogspot.com/2016/12/weve-got-to-back-up-our-sc...</a><br/><br/>(Russell is a smart Republican who doesn't like nonsense.)<br/><br/>Your condemnation of Bolton is one such.",

				"commentBody": "Your statement that Rex Tillerson would somehow be a voice of moderation on global warming is not correct. Exxon still supports Republican climate change deniers with hard cash. Rex is only admitting that climate change is real because his own company made that determination twenty years ago and, unlike President Trump and his other appointees, Rex was unwilling to sound like a complete idiot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Tillerson's solution is to call global warming an \"engineering problem\", leading to speculative solutions like carbon capture and storage. He wants the CCS contracts. This is exactly like hiring the guy who burned your house down to help you figure out how to rebuild it.<br/><br/>Tillerson is what he is. The Times Editorial Board is negligent in not doing its homework here. I am currently attending meetings in San Francisco during AGU about the climate emergency we are facing, and how to address it. We need one of the few remaining credible news organizations- this means you, Times- to do a little homework here. Do not be so needy and damaged from the horror of the Trump presidency to see a  little sunlight in this appointment.<br/>Rex is yet another character in the ongoing Trump horror show, brought to us by our new masters:  Koch, Exxon, Chevron, and Peabody.",

DeVos' schemes to privatize schools for some company's profit make me sick to my stomach. Has her shadow ever darkened the door of a public school? <br/><br/>Schools can be and do many amazing things for the young people they serve. Schools are necessary parts of a healthy society. For sure, Detroit has many systemic problems, and schools cannot be tasked with solving all of them. But the  evidence so far shows that charters do not seem to have improved education, especially for kids in the poorest neighborhoods. <br/><br/>We should resist the spread of this bad scheme. It doesn't matter how many million$ a spoiled heiress throws at a bad idea. It's still a bad idea.",

When I went to public school in Queens decades ago most kids came from intact homes, attended school and cooperated w teachers. The teachers were good. I suspect the quality of teachers is still OK but the students are simply harder to deal w and educate.

They did not have the resources or the money to prepare their children for the UC system.  Public schools in the Berkeley Hills had all the money they needed.  I lived in a neighborhood within walking distance from the Berkeley campus; I graduated from there.  The school system in this university town was not good; I ended up sending my daughter to a private school.  If you wanted your child to go on to university, you opted for private schools if you could afford it.  When we moved to SF, the schools were worse, and more dangerous, than Berkeley's, so more private schools.  Education majors dominated the public school system, and they were the worst educated on any campus.  You could graduate with a degree in Education without ever cracking a book.",

As someone who attended public school throughout the lean Reagan years, education has been under fire my entire life.  There is always some sort of ideological battle taking place between the powers that be, who have no vested interest in helping public schools succeed and absolutely no clue what it takes to foster the kind of learning that develops critical thinkers (ie: good citizens). This neo-con vision that the free-markets will solve any problem presented to us has been disproved time and again, but somehow we can't get away from it.<br/><br/>And hmm, I feel like I've heard something about campaign contributions and democracy...  Of course, it's only natural that DeVos threatened to withhold her millions if the Republican legislators didn't acquiesce to her demand.  Certainly, they did what any self-respecting politician with their career at stake would do; they took the money and shut up. And allow the poor to suffer the consequences. I don't think the majority of Americans understand that this is not how education or politics works in other democracies. ",

She went to a private French school, funded by the French government.  When she graduated, she coasted through high school.  Later she had an easy time at UC Berkeley due to that French school discipline.  Europeans educate their young before university, an excellent basic education.  They do not expect all to go on to university.  They fund good trade schools for those who don't.  We depend on property taxes to provide most funding for public schools.  The poor neighborhoods do not have high property taxes.  Berkeley resorted to busing kids all over town.  Private school became the only option.  Our public school system has been totally corrupted and dominated by poorly educated \"Education\" majors from State colleges.  If you are lucky to live in a well funded district, you get a good public school.  If not, you don't.  ",

							"commentBody": "Chris, interesting you mention Berkeley schools. I graduated from Berkeley High School. I understand from a parental point of view the inconvenience of Berkeley's busing system and lack of true neighborhood schools, and absolutely agree that relying on property taxes severely limits schools. However, BUSD created their busing system during segregation to even the playing field for African Americans and the poor. You probably know this, but they were the first school district in the country to voluntarily integrate schools.  During my time at BHS there was a Frontline PBS documentary filmed on campus about this called \"BHS School Colors\".<br/><br/>Here in Eugene, our best neighborhood schools are in the most affluent neighborhoods, and while we do have school choice / lottery, there is no busing offered if you don't go to your neighborhood school. So as a result, poor people don't end up using the school choice system. <br/><br/>BHS during the 1990s was pretty rough, no doubt. There was graffiti everywhere - I was randomly beat up once. You had to watch your back.  But I also was challenged with some really great teachers and learned how to write and think critically.  I don't think private school is the answer to failing public schools. It takes investment from everyone, and not only our government.",

You are not thought of as innocent nor can you expunge or seal the records which are of course limited to no facts, no testimony, no witnesses, no nothing that can at least try to prove innocence.

I lost 8 of those pounds in the last three months when I finally found what works for me: calorie restriction (paying no attention whatsoever to macronutrient percentages), regular moderate exercise, and most importantly, daily intermittent fasting (I observe a daily fasting period of at least 16 hours).  Even taking all these measures, I can only lose at the rate of half a pound a week!  It took me a long time to accept this fact and now I've slowly lost the weight figuring hey, half a pound a week is still weight loss and will eventually add up to my goal if I just accept this fact and live with it. I'm now thrilled each week to see the scale needle move down by half a pound. I could not have succeeded without the intermittent fasting.  I feel lucky and relieved to have found what works for me, even if the rate of fat loss is glacial.  I'm so clear on what works for me that I no longer ever read up on magazine articles that purport to have the latest weight loss answer.  I used to constantly read such articles looking for a solution. Now I've found my personal secret!  I intend to lose one more pound in these last two weeks leading up to Christmas and it will take discipline and focus, but at least now I'm sure I will succeed! You must find the truth of what works for you and work within those parameters - \"slow and steady wins the race.\"",
