That means that marijuana growers and distributors in Colorado are in an odd spot where they are legal in the state, except if the feds change their minds and decide to go after them (Obama has directed the FBI to not go after marijuana in places where there is compliance with state law, but the next president could change that). Because of that legal ambiguity, everyone in the industry is unable to, for example, open up bank accounts for their business.<br/><br/>Policy matters in political races. Horse-race reporting doesn't acknowledge that simple fact.",

His forecast to date have been blunted by the persistence of the CCP long existence, beyond the history of other communist systems. While the hammer and cycle is still there for backdrop Marxian Communism died somewhere along the path in the early 1990\u2019s.<br/>What persist is a CCP with no alternatives in view, and the best description of it is a tight Leninist grouping searching for policy solutions to a rapidly developing country in an autocratic manner.<br/>They will of necessity evolve into differing forms as they did under Jiang when he opened the party to Capitalists, but autocracy has a long history here and China is not doing too poorly on the economic stage, whatever the real growth rate, it is still way out in front.<br/>Corruption you may have noticed seems to be less shocking in Asia than elsewhere.

This is the party that embraced Rush Limbaugh and all his demagoguery and hatred and divisiveness. This is the party that spat out the word \"liberal\" as if it was spelled with four letters. This is the party that gave us a president who preyed on fear of people in far-off lands, who took advantage of a national tragedy that should have led to our greatest hour, and sent us to war without end that has made this world a more dangerous place. This is the party that has presided while wealth in this nation has concentrated at the very top to a degree unprecedented in U.S. history--the Democrats certainly helped, sure, but the Republicans did nary a thing to stop it and, in fact, did everything possible to ensure it.<br/><br/>This is not the party of Lincoln, Mr. Ryan. Abraham Lincoln would be throwing fits and helping form a new party, just as the Whigs were replaced by Republicans so long ago, if he could see what the GOP has become. This is a party that has richly earned what is coming to it now.<br/><br/>Do not disgrace the name of Abraham Lincoln by claiming that the Republican Party of the 21st century is the party of the greatest president in U.S. history.

Fourth column always divided by 7.  Fifth column was the value of dividing the remaining pearls by 7.  Sixth column added the number of pearls subtracted in column 2 to the number of pearls in column 5.  The number in column 6 was subtracted from the number in column 1 and then placed into the next row of column 1, and all of the formulas were duplicated, adjusting only for the number of subtracted pearls.  I knew I needed numbers that were always divisible by 7 in column 3.  Not very pretty, but neither am I.  I know nothing of slopes or mathematical formulas.  The point is I used some creative thought and tools I understand to get the correct answer by simply manipulating the value in first column of the first row.

I do not think there is an difference between Trump and the other two, and the pathetic Ben Carson and Kasich are clowns without any more humanity.  When it comes to primaries Trump seems to be expressing the sentiments the Republicans have always embraced: racism, bigotry, anti-democracy in denying votes to citizens, foreign policy failures and war mongers, to name only a few of the defects. As far as cutting off his knees before he got out his message, none of the 16 other candidates had very much to offer or they would be the nominee, not Trump. We can hope that Trump will win the nomination, lose badly to Hillary and help destroy what is left of the Republican party.",
