				"commentBody": "Republicans used to win in states like New York. Nelson Rockefeller was our governor, Jacob Javitts our Senator. In '84, Reagan won New York. But those days are long gone. Somewhere over the course of time, Republicans decided to appeal to a different segment of the populace. The Southern strategy of Nixon ballooned into a Bible Belt evangelical movement which had no room for ideas on how to solve problems in urban neighborhoods. Cities suffered from white flight to the suburbs, to what they thought was a better life. Ignoring the problem didn't help, it only further pushed it under the carpet. Absence did nothing to solve anything, and so it only festered.  <br/><br/>To make matters worse, Republicans began nominating candidates who were so out of touch with urban areas the only time you saw them in a metropolis like NY was when they came to beg for money from big donors. <br/><br/>Now the irony is that the GOP for the first time in a long time has as its candidate the ultimate city dweller, someone so out of place in a rural setting no one has ever seen their candidate in casual clothes, and they never will. Yet here in his hometown, we who know him best will vote for Hillary in a landslide. He not only has no redeeming values for solving urban problems, he was the cause of many of them. As for what the GOP will do after yet another defeat? Frankly, who cares.<br/><br/>DD<br/>Manhattan",

As a lifelong Democrat since'60 (JFK), and a native New Yorker, I am preaching to the choir. When Nixon won NY in '72, I voted for McGovern. When Reagan won in '84, I voted for Mondale. I live in a state I am proud to say has voted correctly. <br/><br/>Next week Hillary will take NY in a landslide. The state of Washington will go to Hillary. That being the case, I have never missed an election. Whether my candidate is behind or way ahead, I vote. Always have, always will until I'm six feet under.<br/><br/>But when it comes to Republicans, I have no say. It is not my party, so it us up to Republicans to wise-up, to stop listening to right-wing hate radio and FOX \"News\". If they don't there's nothing I can do. It is the Republican rank and file which deserves a good shellacking come next Tuesday. It is up to Republicans who need to listen to leaders like the Bushes and the Romney's, people who I may not agree with but know how to play the game fairly. They understand the danger Trump brings to their party. He has so lowered the bar it will take years to recover their reputation after putting up a outright demagogue and know-nothing as their candidate. When Republicans realize how ridiculous they look maybe they'll change. But, and this was the point I was trying to make previously, there's nothing I can do to change their minds. <br/><br/>DD<br/>Manhattan<br/><br/>DD<br/>Manhattan",

Whereas other candidates will dress to suit the place their politicking, although they would never wear those outfits were they not in some cornfield in Iowa, Trump at least is not hypocritical. But the other side of the coin is this: Trump finds wearing anything but a power suit demeaning. He thinks most of his supporters are a bunch of hicks. He normally wouldn't be caught dead associating with them. If you can't do something for Trump, he has no use for you. <br/><br/>To Trump, \"flyover country\" is something he's always abided by. Until he was a candidate, Trump always flew over the people he now claims he wants to help. He's never been to any poor rural sections of this country until now. After 70 years on this planet Trump has never cared about what happens to the working poor, except to provide his projects with cheap non-Union work. <br/><br/>That is the irony here. Trump has done nothing to support Labor in any fashion yet he has the white working and non-working class vote supporting him. How sad and pathetic is that? Trump has managed to get people who he disdains to vote for him. There is the work of a true con artist.<br/><br/>DD<br/>Manhattan ",

				"commentBody": "Clinton supporters have revived the 1964 political TV ad with the little girl pulling petals off of a daisy, only to be caught in a nuclear blast.   That commercial was first run back then in support of Lyndon Johnson, who sought to defeat the allegedly \"trigger happy\" Barry Goldwater.<br/><br/>Johnson won that election by a landslide, and was inaugurated to his first full elected term in January 1965.   By that summer, the Johnson Administration fabricated the Golf of Tonkin incident, and what followed was eight years of American conducted war in Southeast Asia.   About 40,000 Americans died in that war, and countless hundreds of thousands were injured.  Millions served, most involuntarily through being drafted.<br/><br/>I don't know what Barry Goldwater would have done had he been elected.   But the Peace and Sanity candidate certainly created a lot of distressed Viet Nam era veterans, who fought bravely in a doomed cause.   Eventually, the North prevailed, Viet Nam was unified, and is now a most favored US trade partner.   <br/><br/>Veterans recognize trigger happy \"send in the troops\" candidates.   Perhaps, due to a lack of natural testosterone, Mrs Clinton feels she must not be seen as militarily meek.  And does so over veterans dead and broken bodies.",
