				"commentBody": ".<br/>Re \"blue\": Police are called \"blue\". \"Blue Lives Matter\" is a phrase some of them use. [Tangentially, I disagree that most police cars are \"black and white\". I would agree with anyone who says police cars are called \"black and whites\".]<br/><br/>[Liz: Comments don't carry tone, so I'll tell you; the following paragraph is explanatory only, not critical of you.] OBRIEN was Winston's interrogator/retrainerish dude: The point at which the sword of State personally met up with Winston Smith. I didn't \"know\" the \"answer\", but the word-length got me halfway there; a letter IN SITU got me almost all the way there. Just didn't know if it was OBRIaN. But regardless of who knew what, \"1984\" is an important, iconic novel that forms part of even a skeletal education. Liz read it, I read it, and a few major names from the book are well within the cultural knowledge Will is entitled to think a Thursday solver will have. Ditto EDIE; Paul Simon's wife who's worked a lot with Steve Martin and whose last name is in the clue? I've written about my solving approach. Here, my approach would be: Fill it in and move on.<br/><br/>Other things Will is entitled to think we know: Just for starters, ACCRA; ARID; NIOBE; ARIAL; AMA; OVINE; RICE; FRAT; CHORD; UPI. But my solving approach is the same when someone doesn't \"know\" the \"answer\". They are squares. We enter letters. [Do I object when we are expected to enter non-letters, or multiple letters? Yes. But my approach says, complain after the grid is abandoned.]",

Further, that until and unless these cybersecurity attacks fully sponsored by the Russian Government are not immediately discontinued and written commitments made that no future acts of interference in the internal political affairs of the United States will be made by Russia and its surrogates, the United States will cease all diplomatic relations with the Russian Government and recall its Ambassador and all diplomatic personnel.  Finally, any further provocation from the Russian Government against any NATO ally will be considered aggressive acts and military readiness measures will be taken to surround Russian forces and those sponsored by Russia now operating in Eastern Europe, including in Eastern Ukraine and the Baltic nations.<br/><br/>Mr. Putin, personally, will be held responsible for any and all acts of further provocation and interference, all of which in the aggregate may constitute acts of war upon the United States.",

Their crossing of each other, in this grid, is the definition of \"a name crossing another name in a puzzle\".<br/><br/>EDIE is a name. Her last name, in the clue, is \"Brickell\". People who Comment here often use Google searches to assess how common something is. For their benefit: When I typed \"edie\" (in quotes) in Google, the first suggestion was \"EDIE Falco\". The second suggestion was \"EDIE Brickell\". Then \"EDIE Parker\" and \"EDIE Sedgwick\". Where's poor EDIE Beale? When I typed \"edie b\" in quotes, guess what the first suggestion was? \"EDIE Brickell\". Searching that in quotes resulted in 529,000 results. I don't claim to know what that means. Searching \"edie brickell\" in the same search box as \"new bohemians\" netted 166,000 results. ACCRA in the same search box as \"lake volta\" yields 40,000 results. EDMOND and Dantes in the same search box yields 369,000 results. EDMOND in a search box with Dantes and \"Count of Monte Cristo\" got me 83,000 results. <br/><br/>Do with that as you [meaning, anyone reading this] wish.<br/><br/>I have bigger fish to fry, namely: Searching for \"MTF Tobin\" in quotes yielded me 9 results, one of which classifies me as \"liberal\". I might know what to do about that if I had the slightest idea what it meant. I see a \"Tobin tax\" as well. Hmmph.<br/><br/>Asking Google to show omitted results expands that to fewer than 90 results. If anyone does that search (and why would you?), the answer is yes, I have donated some of my own tissue to science.",
