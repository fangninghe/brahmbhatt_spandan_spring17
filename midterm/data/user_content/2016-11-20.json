The brakes didn't quite work and the train began to move very slowly, then a bit faster.  It eventually rolled, pretty fast, into town, setting it on fire.  Climate change hasn't \"already\" happened.  We're merely at the start of a long, nasty runaway situation.  The more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we add to the atmosphere, the longer and faster change will continue.  ",

It would seem that Britain doesn't have enough smaller homes into which those older people can move.",

At this point I think he would be accepted by Democrats without hesitation.

I would just add that it is a massive understatement to simply note that Trump's Attorney General nominee - Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III - has a \"history of racially charged statements.\" <br/><br/>In fact, Sessions, who was named after the President of the Confederacy and a leading Confederate general, is an outright racist who has spent much of his career seeking to suppress voting by African Americans as much as possible. As U.S. Attorney, Sessions twice used bogus charges of voter fraud to unsuccessfully prosecute African Americans for working to register voters in the South. He has dismissed the Voting Rights Act as \"intrusive,\" and celebrated when the Supreme Court significantly weakened it. He has done everything in his power to oppose efforts to end mass incarceration. And on immigration, Sessions not only wants to deport millions of people who have committed the misdemeanor of being in the US without documentation, and he wants to curb even entirely legal immigration. <br/><br/>In short, Sessions would bring to the Attorney General position a disturbing history of racist comments and behaviors that are not the types of characteristics we should want in the nation's top law enforcement officer. Democrats must vociferously and unanimously oppose this horrible nominee.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive</a> ",

And when nearly everyone else is exposed to the hurricane, isn't it going to get a just a little overcrowded?<br/><br/>The dance of that's going on is more complex than just \"technology, globalization and Mother Nature\".  There are at least two other factors, labor and capital, and that's without considering population.  <br/><br/>Quite simply, the hurricane of technology and robotics has so devalued the labor of so many people that it's bound to lead to instability.  It has also biased the distribution of capital upwards.  We have more billionaires, more at the low end of the ladder and relatively fewer at the middle rungs.  It's all very well to tout services like Airbnb that we could theoretically sell to each other and sustain ourselves as individual capitalists, but it's very difficult to see how the math works out.   <br/><br/>One given of today's world is that we restrict free movement of people but are ideologically fixated on free movement of capital - which is sold to the people as free trade.   I wonder if some limitation on how capital moves might help reduce migration pressures.   One adverse effect of trade deals has been to undermine indigenous food production in less developed counties, forcing people to migrate.",

There are also clear flaws in your logic and you are factually incorrect:  having 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants  (you use the political correct term 'migrants' ) move back to their own countries would raise wages for the worst off and poorest Americans. It is the law of supply and demand. While the KKK may have endorsed Trump, the Revolutionary Communist party endorsed Jill Stein -- both endorsements are meaningless and a weak red herring in your argument.  Most offensive is that you assume that \"white Christians\" all have the same identify politics -- we don't.  In your very phrasing you create \"the other\" and lower yourself down to the primitive school yard name calling you decry in others.",

The entitled upper middle class owes the precariat (lower middle class, working class, the poor) an apology for not standing up for them and expecting them to vote against their interests as they fared better in this unequal economy. Kurt Eichenwald and his colleagues who have demonized the working class and minorities for not voting for the upper middle class and the .01%'s candidate can now go ask themselves how to unify the party before it disintegrates. They participated in a dangerous game of collusion in an attempt to sway public opinion through propaganda and games of divide and conquer. Not enough people bought into it and now we have Trump. <br/><br/>The myth the media spread is that only well-to-do right wing racists masquerading as working class would vote for Trump. It didn't quite turn out to work that way and it angered millions of lower middle and working class Democrats.<br/><br/>Who are those angry white voters? <a href=\"http://www.rimaregas.com/2016/06/profiling-the-angry-american-in-this-new-political-and-economic-era-blog42/\" title=\"http://www.rimaregas.com/2016/06/profiling-the-angry-american-in-this-new-political-and-economic-era-blog42/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.rimaregas.com/2016/06/profiling-the-angry-american-in-this-ne...</a><br/><br/>Were white voters the only ones who were angry?
