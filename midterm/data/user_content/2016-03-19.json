				"commentBody": "Gail Collins correctly reported that Trump said that his most important foreign policy adviser was himself.  He presumably talks to himself when he seeks edification on international affairs.<br/><br/>He is patently as mad as a hatter. As we all know, his narcissism knows no bounds.   In many circumstances a man with such an aberrant conception of himself and the world would be deposited in an institution.  However, this man is lauded and adored by the media and he is well on his way toward capturing a party which once nominated Abraham Lincoln.<br/>Why does he fare so well.   Because he is filthy rich.  And what does this prove?  This proves that Capitalism is often a grotesque system because it posits a perfect correlation between monetary wealth and inherent worth, i.e., if you are very rich, you are deemed to be intrinsically morally and intellectually superior.  Actually, Harvard proved the falsity of Capitalism's assumption that great wealth was indicative of inherent superiority.  IN 1968, that school's psychology department found that the variable that correlated most strongly with financial wealth was the ability to look someone in the eye and lie at the same time.  That, my friend, is the art of the deal.<br/>Feel the Bern.    ",

When I was growing up cauliflower must have been more expensive than cabbage, zucchini, or (gag) succotash, so I rarely got it. While raising our own children we've eaten megatons of broccoli since my daughter decided it was da bomb. But she has since moved out and eats her own broccoli at least once a day. It is my time  to enjoy a paler, tastier cruciferous vegie. If others find it to be bland, I say, \"Tough, that leaves more for me!\"",

Home cooks will be using canola, better if they use peanut, better if it is organic, but they will not be using commercial deep fryer fat (like McDonalds, etc.). So no, the fat here is absolutely NOT the problem, but rather the worse thing in the recipe is the panko bread crumbs and whatever flour gets used and however much sugar is in the tartar sauce. But, that said, fry up you fish: the flour panko and sugar is not all that much compared other common dietary foodstuffs in terms of making people overweight and messing with their blood sugar.<br/><br/>But seriously, It's really waaaay past time that the Times stops adhering to the \"fat is bad\" mantra and passes along the memo to all the food-section staff.",

Because both of these school maintain academic standards for players and expect them to attend class, do their own work, take their own exams and graduate with real degrees? <br/><br/>The USAToday writer admits his loathing is driven by simply jealousy, then does on to spew a bunch of cliches about how every Duke or Yale grad makes huge amounts of money, is selfish, elitist and entitled.<br/><br/>This Dukie does not \"make so much money it would make me physically sick if I saw your bank account\" - in fact, a Duke magna cum laude degree is no proof against being laid off during the recession and then falling victim to age discrimination.  I am revolted by Duke's recent spending and elasticity of the rules in pursuit of football prowess and think the fetishization of the hoops team is stupid and crass.  However, the resentment and \"hatred\" toward students who can perform at high levels both academically and athletically, and the anger at schools that demand that they do so, is ugly and destructive.<br/><br/>The only thing 'insufferable' about the prospect of a Duke-Yale match up is that a pairing of such true student-athletes happens so very infrequently.",

Namely, what other job do you see where a 14 yr old boy goes to work with his father EVERY DAY for the WHOLE DAY? Exactly, none. They wanted him to scale it back, and he refused to compromise. They didn't release him...he quit. I give him credit for not going all Lawyer on them and trying to sue for breach of contract. We should just chalk it up to a clash of beliefs and let it go. Now he can spend his time home-schooling 365 days a year and coach his sons teams. Everybody wins...except maybe the White Sox locker room, which seems full of dissension.",

Although unpalatable, there is one way out: vote for the democratic candidate, so reason may prevail, reality recognized for what it is, so that politics may recognize 'compromise' as a necessary and welcome tool to get things done.

So epic is the cache of hidden traits that have been uncovered by that living, breathing, short-fingered Rohrshach Test.<br/><br/>But that is not a sign that he can win the 2016 presidential election. In my opinion, he cannot. Ahead of him are numerous speeches and appearances, debates, delegate-selection events, encounters with State law and rules, a party Convention, more campaigning, more debates, attacks on him by PACs, financial realities, more encounters with State law and rules, voting, election litigation, and the Electoral College process.<br/><br/>At one of those junctures, he will be thwarted. Either his pursuit of office will actually end (he will fail to qualify for the ballot in enough states, e.g.) or it will figuratively grind to a halt (as happened to the unqualified Marco Rubio when his adopted home state did not support him for nomination).<br/><br/>We have tremendous cause for worry about our nation. There are unknowns which could turn out to be immensely disturbing. But our worries need not include the chance of Donald Trump taking the Presidential Oath next January.",

Their view was: we're picking Hillary, don't give the voters any other choice. And because of the utter failure of the Fourth Estate to do its job, and instead becoming the  mouthpiece of the Clinton Campaign, they have largely succeeded in making it extremely difficult for a different candidate to get basic airtime and serious consideration. <br/><br/>The Repubs on the other hand, are just going to do a brazen, late-in-the-game  power grab.<br/><br/>Given JFK's words: \"Those who would make a peaceful revolution impossible, make a violent revolution inevitable\", wouldn't it be wiser for the elite/establishment/1% to reconsider their game plan of seizing power in whatever undemocratic way they can, and start working for the American People instead of Wall Street and the Koch Brothers?",

Trump's popularity represents the sour grapes of a contingent of scared xenophobic working class conservatives--who DO have legitimate economic problems--who think that blowing a raspberry toward Washington is an effective way to register their displeasure.  But these conservatives don't seem to have any decent ideas about how to fix what they deem to be broken, or how getting the rot out of Congress, and local legislatures, might be a first step; they just want the good feeling that comes with being angry and denigrating, because that's about all the pleasure they can afford these days.<br/><br/>(If they had any sense, and weren't so easy to lead into the divide and conquer trap set up by cynical plutocrats, they might consider voting for Bernie.   But \"you're getting what you don't deserve\" seems to Trump--pun intended--\"we're all in this together\" every time.)",

For 7 plus years the GOP has voted against the ACA forever and followed Ted to close down the government and ruin American's vacations to National Parks and cost the government they hate millions. Seven years and no higher minimum wage, no additional spending on infrastructure (jobs, jobs, jobs and much needed improvements-even Donald recognizes our airports need work!), no support for women's health, no tax reduction for the middle class &amp; lower, no help with education expenses, no support for renewable energy,  ... Nothing has been done to improve anyone's life. And this party of white men wonder why there is a fire in the party they cannot control or suffocate? Their racist attitude toward Pres. Obama has diminished their party and hurt our nation. Unfortunately, those supporting the current GOP candidates are still blaming the wrong people. Rather than attacking immigrants and Muslims and every other group they don't like, these followers need to attack the regulars of the party who have done nothing for 7 plus years. ",
