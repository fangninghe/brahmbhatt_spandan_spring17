				"commentBody": "\"The growth of the job market while this statistic remains week is simply due to population growth...\"<br/><br/>Actually, none of the growth of the job market is due to population growth since babies and toddlers don't work.  Since it is is simply wrong to mix together people who want jobs and those who don't, the best measure is appropriately called \"not in the labor force, want a job now\" (BLS series ID  LNS15026639).  Last I checked (last month) the percentage of people in this category was lower than it was at comparable points following the milder recessions of 1981-82 and 1990-91.  And that is true whether the denominator is the labor force or the Civilian Noninstitutional Population.  <br/><br/>So, the question is:  following the worst recession since the Great Depression, how is it that we are doing better when it comes to people who aren't in the labor force even though they want jobs than we did following two recent milder recessions?",
