Fishermen came every day to sell us their fresh catch.<br/>It was a cold, wet dreary day, raining outside for the interview. After talking about the flying and showing pictures of the wild game I had seen in the Masai Mara, and Amboseli, one of the Captains asked me, \"Why are you here?\" The next Captain said, \"How can I get a job over there?\"<br/>So the interview had turned around quickly!",

				"commentBody": "The IRS's most comprehensive study of taxpayer compliance (National Research Program--NRP) based on intensive audits of 42,000 returns revealed that most taxpayers cheat when they think they can get away with it, usually when income they receive is not reported to the IRS by the source of the income. NRP proved Will Rogers to be 100 percent accurate when he opined, \"The income tax has made liars out of more Americans than golf.\"<br/><br/>I'm sure, sfdphd, you are much more honest than most of your fellow Americans, who don't pay their taxes because they are proud to support their country, pay because they fear the consequences of not paying and being caught. Without any near competitor, the IRS is the most feared agency in the U.S. People don't pay taxes because they want to, they pay because they are coerced into paying-or else. You paint a pretty, patriot picture of yourself. You say you don't complain. May I point out that it wouldn't do you any good if you did. Even tax heroes like yourself do their utmost to minimize hoe much they pay, which doesn't indicate a particular fondness for their nation so much as it reflects the fact that not paying has severe consequences. Taxation is virtually indistinguishable for extortion as practiced by the Mafia, except it is better organized and exponentially more productive. Calling paying taxes a duty is akin to putting lipstick on a pig.",

				"commentBody": "\"Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders announced he is going to the Vatican, where he hopes to meet with the pope.\"<br/><br/>Hopes to meet with the pope? He was invited by the Vatican to speak there! \"Hoping to meet with the pope\" sounds like a teen who goes to a concert in the hope of meeting their idol. That just isn't the case. Why write like that? What purpose does it serve. Does such an opportunity really need to be minimized? I know, this column is usually written in a lighthearted tone, but really... It is precisely the sentiment behind this kind of writing is what prompted Reuters to ask a Vatican official if Sanders had invited himself to the event.  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-vatican-idUSKCN0X5257\" title=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-vatican-idUSKCN0X5257\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-vatican-idUSKCN0X5257</a><br/><br/>As for Sanders acting \"a little off...\" There is a good reason for it. The Clinton campaign signaled, through cable news, at first, that is was going negative, right on the night of the Wisconsin primary. Sanders dished out what he was served. I hope the Clinton campaign will think better of things in the future <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2ao\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2ao\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2ao</a> <br/><br/>The person who really acted off this week was Bill Clinton. He has a history of of getting awkward while campaigning for his wife. <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2aG\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2aG\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2aG</a><br/><br/>As for who is more of a New Yorker, one only need to hear Sanders speak to know how much New York is a part of him. <br/><br/>This election cycle is about the issues, no matter how hard some try to make it personal. It's about neoliberalism vs. progressivism. ",

A graduate of my high school who belongs to the \"EGOT\" club owes his Tony and his Grammy to said humorous musical.<br/><br/>I have not seen the musical, but my understanding is that it treats Mormons affectionately as being earnest and likable. Matt Stone and Trey Parker grew up in Colorado, where there was some LDS influence. I read somewhere that many of their collaborations make some reference or other to the LDS Church.<br/><br/>The official church position -- again based upon my reading -- is non-opposition. The church has even advertised in the musical's program (Playbill), urging the curious to check out the real Book of Mormon. I only know what I read, but it's said that some people have pursued their curiosity to such a degree that they have joined the church.",

For many Sanders supporters, this is the sin that cannot be forgiven. <br/><br/>While I absolutely disagree with the decision to invade Iraq, it is important to consider the context of the Senate vote at the time. The Bush Administration had employed the CIA to concoct false intelligence reports that \"proved\" Saddam had WMD. Those reports were then shared in a dramatic presentation by Secretary of State Colin Powell at the United Nations. The target for said WMD was unquestionably Israel. The State of NY is keenly interested in the security of Israel.<br/><br/>HRC could have done a Joe Wilson \"You Lie!\" on the Senate floor, but lacking her own contravening intelligence operation, had to vote based on the information provided by the Executive to the Senators. <br/><br/>This was not an easy vote in the wake of the devastating impact of 9/11 on New York. Hilary says she regrets the vote. But she did enjoy an approval rating in the range of 75% through her two terms as NY Senator. <br/><br/>For those who like me who believe the Iraq War was the biggest foreign policy blunder since Vietnam, it is important to bear in mind that the criminal act was committed by the CIA and the President, rather than the Senate.

Bernie will have similar problems, only worse, if he is elected. That's why a negotiator with roots in the larger community, tarnished by a life lived in the public eye under constant Republican opposition work, may have more success than a stalwart who never gives us.

The authors blame this absentmindedness on what they view as misguided conservative ideology.\"<br/><br/>\"In Hacker and Pierson's expansive account of the history of U.S. politics, by contrast, the government isn't just a means for redistribution or even an economic handicap. Rather, they argue, the government is a crucial source of economic growth.\"<br/><br/>Specifically, they write, one of the main reasons that we're so much better off than previous generations of Americans is that the government can make people do things for society's benefit that they wouldn't ordinarily do, such as pasteurize their milk and vaccinate their kids. Also, the government can make people pay taxes to fund lucrative investments in education, scientific research and the construction of roads and rails -- to name a few . . ..",

Had Venezuela or Zimbabwe been on the gold standard in the first place, how much wealth would there have been for Chavez or Mugabe to pillage?  What's more, you seem to be confusing ownership of gold with gold as a currency. Nothing would have stopped someone in Venezuela from stocking their safe with gold bullion pre Chavez or Mugabe.  Or Platinum. Or jewels. Or objets d'art. What's more, you're making the bizarre assumption that, assuming these countries were on the gold standard,had you attempted to exchange your bills for gold, the kleptocrats would have honored your request",

							"commentBody": ".<br/>Hillary Clinton has raised money for organizations that can dole it out to candidates for state offices and for Congress; or to consultants and experts who will be vital to Democratic wins now and in the future. Remember 2012 when Obama's computers worked like a charm and Romney's worked so poorly they were abandoned? Computer expertise usually costs a little money. Has Bernie Sanders raised any money for the DNC?<br/><br/>Governing a country is not like putting up the tallest, most appealing building. It is more like installing infrastructure -- sewers, aqueducts, subway and train tunnels, cable -- and then building all kinds of buildings, of all sizes and for all purposes.<br/><br/>Will young people be drawn to scale models of the glistening tower? Sure. But which description fits the most livable, workable construction?<br/><br/>Anyway, nothing at all augurs a Clintonian fall in the New York primary. And there are only 2 caucus states left after that. Besides, the highly democratic Democratic delegate apportionment rules mean the 2nd-place finisher usually gets delegates in every state. Mathematically, Sanders thus has very little chance to close the pledged-delegate gap he created by not properly campaigning in the South. His Minnesota, Nevada, and Missouri delegates won't do him much good against her Texas delegates.<br/><br/>And in the general election, she will suffer for her \"negatives\" (increased by personal attacks in verse or prose). But my passion is the Electoral College. She'll win that!",
