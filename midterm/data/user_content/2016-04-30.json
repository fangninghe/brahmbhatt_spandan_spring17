Even a life-time Arsenal fan cannot wait to see this extraordinary team winning the most competitive league in any sport in all the world. It's like a junior high basketball team playing an entire season in the NBA and winning the championship title at the end. You could not make this up.",

This story is so great, so compelling precisely because the opposite is true. In the worlds most competitive league, you would not be able to play rock-paper-scissors and choose Chelsea, Man-U or Man-City and be right 90% of the time. I can't think of a less competitive league, frankly...  Maybe Spanish Premira. <br/><br/>No, you need to look no farther than the bookies to tell this story: 5000-1.",

							"commentBody": "Brian, it is, by far, the richest league in the world, and it distributes revenues more equitably than any other European League does. Even relegation bait, which Leicester was last year, sign big name internationals. Last year, Leicester's best player was former Inter treble winner and Argentine international Estebian Cambiasso. Why 5000-1 to win the league? Cambiasso left. Incredibly, Leicester signed Swiss International Gokhan Inler away from Napoli, where he'd seen regular CL action, to replace Cambiasso, but with the instant emergence of Kante, he hardly played at all, and might be the closest to a bust of the players Ranieri brought in.<br/>The media rights are so yuge going forward that there will be more talent on all sides up and down the division.",

Maybe not Ranieri's \"Hollywood ending,\" but a pretty darn good one, and one which gives a better shot to the three amazing youngsters at ManU of playing in Europe next year.  But any way they do it, hoping Leicester wins the league.  They are playing full throttle all-in soccer from start to finish, on both offense and defense.  They deserve to win.  Feel sorry for Tottenham, realizing they've never won the BPL either, but they are an incredibly powerful team and should remain a force for years to come.",

				"commentBody": "It was great circumstance to allow Leicester to do this. They went on a run under Nigel Pearson to actually escape relegation going away. But Ranieri is an undoubted upgrade. Remarkably, Ranieri has never won a league championship, but has finished second...a lot. His Roma side in 2010 lost a lead late to allow Mourinho's Inter the chance for its treble. He finshed second with Chel$ki, which impelled the Ru$$ian Oligarch to replace him with Mourinho, fresh off winning the European Cup with Porto.<br/>Ranieri made three impact buys. He plucked N'Golo Kante from obscurity in France to be short listed for the EPL player of the year. He got Christian Fuchs on a free. And those clean sheets started about when Fuchs forced his way into the every match XI. Experienced, he scored the last goal last year at the Bernabeu when Schalke almost pulled off an impossible comeback against Real. He's their left footed outside dead ball and corner man. And he bought Shinji Okazaki, a starter at Mainz. Not a bust in the group. Okazaki helped pick up when Vardy cooled down to human performance.<br/>But Leicester also had a complete absence of impact injuries, and nobody lost form enough to adversely impact performance, either.<br/>It's a remarkable performance, a remarkable collective overachievement. And in Ranieri, this couldn't happen to a classier gaffer.",

You're right to mention Fuchs and Okazaki - their heroism has been relatively unsung.

The GOP fascination with sexual proclivities must have some sort of mental aberration driving it. It seems to have the same psychological underpinnings attributed to most perverts.<br/><br/>Fundamentalist Christianity is another mental disturbance, I can just imagine Cruz making an executive order banning theories of modern geology, evolution, paleontology, cosmology, or other modern discoveries relating to science. <br/><br/>This is the laughing stock of the GOP, Trump comes in second in this category. They have brought it on themselves with constant rants opposing rational social and economic programs. They have demonized their opponents for years now, and the  Proletariat is beginning to realize just what fabricators of the facts they are. Their promises have failed, their personal attacks on Democratic leaders have been shown to be despicable and mean spirited. <br/><br/>You can only get away with such for awhile, eventually it catches up to you. Now they are tied to two of the most unsavory candidates in their history. It is fun to watch the GOP self destruct, it has earned it.",

We are three hours behind you here.<br/><br/>As we have seen from the studies Trump supporters have abut the lowest educational level, and income level among the GOP voters. Their understanding of the government comes from sources such as Fox News, Rush, and other right wing sources that sound plausible. Conspiracy ideas are part of their lives, helping to explain why they have not got ahead like many of their neighbors.<br/><br/>They have lost their jobs to companies that sent their sources to other countries and believe those countries are \"stealing\" those jobs. The do not have the technical know how to compete at a higher level. This is not true of all of them of course, and there are those who profit by keeping these people in the fold.<br/><br/>They are also believers in the America the great, ignoring the fat, that citizens of other countries believe their own country to be great. America first means more than just it is my home and I love it. I means America has to dominate everyone else. For awhile we did, but we also exported our ideas elsewhere and they are catching up. They have been told the politicians have sold them out, and it makes sense to them. <br/><br/>I could go one here the more I think about it, but have an opera to go see. Thanks for asking.",

Many little kids and pre-teens loved K-tel records because they were cheaper than \"real\" albums, didn't seem to offend our parents, and gave access to a larger variety of music than we heard on the radio.<br/><br/>Interesting that the NYT published such a charming obituary, yet the Canadian media are silent about this legendary businessman's death. Probably many people didn't even know he was from Canada. ",
