				"commentBody": "Would like to communicate offline if possible.  Key to understanding disdain working class feels towards more educated (cultural elites, public intellectuals, professionals) is demise of alternative upward mobility path to the higher education / meritocracy path.  Within large manufactural firms with unions, internal labor markets (ILMs) were created that created opportunities for those without college degrees.  With demise of ILMs, all that is left is higher ed. route, and those who have not and often can not compete in the meritocratic systems are worse off.  Workers feel that those with higher ed degrees look down on them because they have not succeeded in the educational world and do not see the value in the knowledge people gain outside schools.  It is not that workers are jealous of the life-styles of more educated people, but the status hierarchy of education that devalues what those without college credentials know and asks those who are not experts to defer to the experts.  The existence other opportunities for people without college degrees is critical to diminishing the elitism associated with higher education.   ",

				"commentBody": "This paper is just confounding. Does it EVER correct misstatements by politicians? Donald Trump's victory was not \"one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history.\" This is basic stuff, New York Times! Both of Ronald Reagan's victories (1980, 1984), Bill Clinton's victories (1992, 1996), AND Barack Obama's victories (2008, 2012) were by larger electoral margins than Trump's. AND Trump lost the popular vote by a larger margin than 8 presidents have won! Come on. Don't let these kinds of blatant misstatements (lies?) stand. You are the newspaper of record, and you're allowing disinformation as strong as that injected into this past election to stand and proliferate.<br/><br/>To the topic at hand, is anyone seriously surprised by the news that not just the DNC but RNC was hacked, in part to influence this election? The question is, why did the US media actively participate in spreading the propaganda and disinformation that this hack of the Democrats produced? Why wasn't there more pushback, more critical articles, more skepticism about not just the hacked and leaked material, but the reasons why it was hacked and released, and how it might be functioning in conjunction with all the fake news, the misinformation and disinformation, and the blatant lies being spread regularly by politicians? The US media fell down on the job again and again. I'm glad the president is calling for a report, but it's a bit late, no?",

We know that the vast majority of local elections officials have limited resources to detect or defend against cyber attacks. And while pre-election polls have large uncertainties, they were consistently off. And various aspects of the preliminary results, such as a high rate of under votes for president, have aroused suspicion.\" Still Time for an Election Audit, 11/18/2016 \u2013 USA Today. Also note Wisconsin hasn\u2019t voted a Republican presidential candidate into office since 1984, Michigan since 1988. All of Wisconsin\u2019s major polls, predicted a Clinton win by significant margins: Remington Research: Clinton 49%, Trump 41% (11/06/16); Loras College: Clinton 44%, Trump 38%(11/04/16); Marquette Law: Clinton 46%, Trump 40% (11/02/16); Public Policy: Clinton 48%, Trump 41% (11/02/16).  Aided by redistricting Republicans took more seats in Michigan even when Democrats won the majority of votes; a scenario replayed in GOP-controlled states.

Obama in running down Bin Laden; lifting the country out of the deepest (Republican) recession since the Great Depression, and rebuilding the U.S. auto industry.  The stock market under President Obama has risen to new record highs, and millions of jobs have been created.  Twenty million Americans now have health care insurance who never had it before.  The Republicans have never passed legislation that has benefited millions of Americans such as Medicare and Social Security; those programs were conceived by Democrats.  Republicans have created nothing to benefit working class Americans on this level.  And they probably never will.  So we're not blaming Russians for anything quite yet and until we know the truth about their possible involvement in our election, we will withhold judgement.  But I doubt our President would launch this investigation if he did not have some evidence of Russian interference.  You sound like a very bitter person.  Maybe you, too, should wait for the results of the investigation before you label it a joke.  The joke may be on you.",

To me this whole revelation should be grounds for overturning the election results.  There has been interference from a foreign power in the election process, and Trump may have been complicit - we should not forget that his top advisor at one point was a man who worked with Russian politicians.  If it can be shown that  Paul Manafort had any knowledge of this tampering whatsoever, and remained silent, then he committed treason, and if he passed any information along to Donald Trump who remained silent, then he too committed an act of treason, by conspiring with a foreign government to influence an election. Now is the time to act before Donald Trump takes the oath of office.  This cannot and should not be dismissed as an election prank or political dirty tricks, it is far too serious for that.",

The polls were very consistent in their conclusions.<br/>I maintain that ANYTHING can be hacked and I say this from a background in information technology. <br/><br/>This election was hacked and it is to be hoped that somewhere some capable group or organization will take up the task of proving this to be or not to be the case. Let chips fall ..... wherever. <br/><br/>The Freedom of Information Act should be applied to study the system analysis for the compilation of voting results and applied to the study and examination of the software developed for the implementation of the system itself.<br/>Modifying numbers to meet predetermined outcomes is certainly possible.<br/>In fact examination of just 4 or 5 important states could well suffice.<br/>Another question: Where was the system and the software developed and what specific entities where involved in this effort. Did it have backdoors. <br/><br/>Trump decided to run for president - a great surprise to the world at large - and he did so because he knew that he would win.<br/>His entire outrageous and offensive campaign, his demeaning attitude toward many groups of persons, and his blatant over-confidence and swagger was possible because he knew he would win.<br/>Rigged? He knew for sure.<br/>Q.E.D. Anyone. ",

Wisconsin hasn\u2019t voted a Republican presidential candidate into office since 1984, Michigan since 1988. Yet all of Wisconsin\u2019s major polls, predicted a Clinton win by significant margins: Remington Research: Clinton 49%, Trump 41% (11/06/16); Loras College: Clinton 44%, Trump 38%(11/04/16); Marquette Law: Clinton 46%, Trump 40% (11/02/16); Public Policy: Clinton 48%, Trump 41% (11/02/16). GOP-led states put in place new voter restrictions controlled 70% of the E.C.,  yet only 26% of eligible voters voted for Trump.
