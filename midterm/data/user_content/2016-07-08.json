It had a lovely, crackery crust and airy interior. It was quite a challange getting it off the pizza peel onto the baking stone - the loaf rolled over itself and had a spiral of cornmeal inside, which added a nice bit of crunch to the bread. Use more cornmeal than you think you need! Very easy recipe, I will make it again.",

Ms. Clinton was found to be \"extremely careless\" with our country's sensitive information by the FBI head.  That sends a strong no confidence message to me on her ability to perform the duties of the Presidency successfully.  I believe if Bernie Sanders expresses the same no confidence in Hillary Clinton then the American people will reward him with their vote for him come November. whether he runs on the Democratic ticket or not.  If you agree with me then why don't you go ahead and ask Bernie Sanders to not quit.  He CAN win the nomination.  It's up to YOU.",

Sanders will be on board, Hillary will be the nominee, and proceed to clean Trump's Clock Tower. <br/><br/>Hillary and Sander are two old pros whose experience has kept them both in the public office spotlight for decades. They did not get there by doing what you propose which is a do or die scenario. They will work out a win-win compromise that will unite the Democratic Party for the convention in Philly and then on to the General Election. <br/><br/>Hillary has been there done that. She is competent capable and has run one of the most professional campaigns in history. She is where she is out of determination and fortitude and a masterful approach at organization. It is why she will make an excellent president. <br/><br/>What you call for is not going to happen. Sanders is not crazy. He's a wily chess master who has played an excellent match, but he knows when to concede, and after getting all the concession he can.  Your simplistic and naive notions are spoken in truly amateurish tones. Politics is not as you surmise like the pure driven snow. It's a lot of slush and mud. It's not a pretty sight and not for the fainthearted. That's why Hillary and Sanders are survivors.<br/><br/>DD<br/>Manhattan",

I don't want much, but his voting AGAINST the Brady Bill and voting FOR the PLCAA-the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act  legislation that enables Gun Manufacturers and Gun Dealers from being sued) should be on the table, especially as we continue to witness the ever present 'gun violence' that exists in our country.  <br/><br/>Sanders's defenders knee-jerk reaction to this criticism is how he gets a D- on the NRA's Report card. Well, let's make it an F by having him vote FOR The Brady Bill, legislation simply requiring a reasonable waiting period before the purchase of a firearm, and AGAINST the PLCAA-The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, the act that protects Gun Manufacturers and Gun Dealers from being sued. And because half of Sanders's constituency are gun owners, this will not be an easy 'ask' of  nor his complying with this request to climb from the bed of the NRA, the Gun Lobby, and Gun Manufacturers on these issues. <br/><br/>It is because of his reluctance to stand up to the NRA and the Gun Lobby on these issues that he lost the Democratic Nomination. His supporters are primarily students trying to get out from beneath their Student Loan Debt and gun owners. Result-he lost. ",

In this incident, they seemed much more concerned with detaining the girlfriend, than determining what to do next for the victim.  How tragic for her, her daughter to humiliated so, while someone they cared for was murdered before their eyes.  What should be the take away of the little girl to see such a thing?
