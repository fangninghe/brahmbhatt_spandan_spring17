				"commentBody": "Mr. Friedman brings up a very serious point about humanity that illustrates the danger of the guns everywhere push by the right.  People are not rational.  People are emotional.  Some of us are just plain nuts.  Furthermore, many of us are on the edge and can go nuts at any moment.  What is road rage?  Why get upset because someone changed lanes in front of you?  Who cares?  But yet road rage happens everyday, committed by so called rational people.<br/><br/>Then we have the free speech libertarian types who believe that anyone should be able to say anything anywhere.  This is another push toward crazy fostered by the right.  And of course the internet, with its social networking, amplifies crazy talk by orders of magnitude.<br/><br/>Those that have fallen off the edge of rational behavior suck this stuff up.  Only one of them has to pull the trigger and change world events.  But oh my, do we love to say crazy stupid things.  Do we ever love to incite passion, especially hate and anger.<br/><br/>For free speech to work and serve any useful purpose in society, it has to be responsible speech.  Here come the strict constitutionalists and great legal minds warning about the speech police and how do you identify it and how do you enforce it.  Well folks, it's real simple.  Don't threaten to kill anyone or incite others to kill anyone.  This isn't another slippery slope argument.  It's an argument about falling off a cliff into chaos and mob rule.         ",

She should categorically say that she supports the right to bear arms. Making common sense regulations of semi automatic weapons and high number magazines is NOT taking away the right to bear arms and reasonable people know this. Hillary Clinton should come out and call a spade a spade.
