				"commentBody": "'The system is broken.' Sure, of course, but what system? We of the money-chase have created the most unequal of all industrial societies. And now, we're surprised the poor students do worse than the rich students? Really? How utterly hypocritical of us. As an ex-high school teacher at a large, mainly poor, multi-ethnic school, I see our educational 'views' as worse than fake. We don't really care about equality or the poor or low-wage families in this country. Nobody really cared about my kids. Maybe you give them free lunch and a few food stamps, but 'quality of life'? No way. Not even close. We celebrate Bill Gates getting his $90 billion, but admit nothing about how that concentration of wealth has a counterpoint called poverty. No, no one can have billions of dollars without someone else living in a ghetto. That's why our ghettos persist: we don't care. We're more interested in becoming rich and staying that way (or increasing our booty).<br/>My kids were so wonderful. Awesome and inspiring individuals. But, many worked after school, till midnight, many nights, and then came to school the next day. You say they have low literacy and low grades? Well, of course they do, we have them in school 7 hours a day and at work for 5! We're addicted to the idea of riches, which leads us down a dirty road of winners (few) and losers (many). Not surprising that many Republicans want to do away with any and all ideas of a 'minimum wage'; the more slave-like the better. Schools? No, life.",

Anecdotally I can tell you it makes a difference. The research is pretty clear that the chances of success for a student rely more on involved parents (or parent) than a good school.<br/><br/>I've talked with Milwaukee teachers who deal with many kids who come to school with no breakfast in their bellies, no boots in the winter, and no school supplies. Some kids in Milwaukee move so often they could attend up to 5 schools in a school year. It's hard to complete your homework in these situations. No improvements to those schools will make a difference. <br/><br/>This writer of this column, and the judge she's writing about, need to complete the picture on education.

That is why states, for the welfare of their citizens, undertook compulsory education actions beginning in the late 1800s.  These laws, requiring children to attend school, gave the opportunity for children of illiterate farmers and factory workers to attend school and gave them the analytical skills to, among other things, form unions and bargain for their labor.  This state action led to the creation of the middle class in the 1950s, mostly for white Americans.  Unfortunately, we have lost this commitment to one another and never had the same commitment to education for minorities and immigrants of color.  We now leave the educational system to be misused and abused by partisan politicians at the federal, state and local levels.  We need to come together and demand equal access to a good education for all regardless of race, color or economic station.  Until parents and non-parents do this, we will continue to accept a class of underprivileged children who are not educated and grow up to be the next generation of underprivileged parents \"failing\" their children.

				"commentBody": "Mr. Edsall's column is truly blood-chilling because the conspiracy theories outlined by him and his commentariat predecessors are so evident in the rhetoric of figures who are terminally tendentious (Trump, Coulter) and those who, as vile as they are, should know better (Giuliani, Hannity).<br/><br/>Such figures flirt with treason because, in order to advance their own dark agendas, they call into question the legitimacy of American constitutional governance itself. These figures are hardly naughty children playing with matches. They are stage-managing a conflagration on the core body politic, promoting the noxious fiction that their particular victory is the only signal of a fair outcome.<br/><br/>So, the mantra is \"We win; it was fair. We lose; the system was rigged.\" If a critical mass of voters adopts such a fantasy, then governance itself would be short-circuited, but nowhere as severely as if the conspiracists should actually win.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.endthemadnessnow.org\" title=\"www.endthemadnessnow.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.endthemadnessnow.org</a>",

We've seen that the big money vets, picks, groom, and markets our candidates, and candidates position themselves to attract the big money when they decide to run in the 1st place. <br/><br/>While our news media  NEVER talks about this, but actually reports on the fund raising contest in our elections. And then compares personalities, power plays and polls for our entertainment. <br/><br/>Public financing of elections, common in other world democracies, could tamp down the 'paranoid' in our politics, and let our leaders give us some representation for our taxation.<br/>As long as big money works behind the scenes to set the parameters of platforms, paranoid accusations of rigged elections will flower---and have some basis in reality. <br/><br/>There are jokes about psychiatrists treating paranoids who realize that somebody really is out to get them, after all.

				"commentBody": "The real election fraud is the long time Republican effort to stop minority voters from casting their ballots.  This goes back decades.  William Rehnquist got his start harassing minority voters in Arizona in the early 1960's.  He was rewarded by Republicans by being installed as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.  In recent years, things have gotten worse in Republican controlled states.  Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and Wisconsin have new voter restriction laws for the 2016 Presidential election.  North Carolina and North Dakota passed such laws, but they have been overturned by the courts.  Florida, West Virginia, Illinois, and South Dakota and Iowa passed such laws for the 2012 Presidential election.  A few Republican politicians have confirmed and even bragged about the fact that these laws are designed to help Republicans, just as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy bragged that the Benghazi hearings were set up by House Republicans to bring Hillary Clinton's favorable numbers down.  Republicans are also very accomplished at dirty tricks to try to bring down Democratic votes, such as sending a \"notice\" that looks official to Democrats with the wrong date for elections.",
