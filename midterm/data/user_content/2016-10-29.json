				"commentBody": "This is not \"nothing\". This speaks directly to Hillary's judgement. She kept close a woman, Abedin, who clearly should not have had access to government business. Any competent executive, any competent leader would have long, long ago replaced her if for no other reason than she continued to be married to a sex offender. Sex offenders are highly susceptible to manipulation by foreign governments, etc. I would not expect you highly biased NYT commenters to be willing to accept this. I was not going to vote because I don't like either candidate, but I am now going to vote and vote for Trump because I can't stand the thought of the Clintons back in OUR White House. Enough is enough.",
