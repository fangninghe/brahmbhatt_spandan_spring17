				"commentBody": "This article fails to clarify several key points about the US healthcare system. First, physician and nurse compensation is only a very small percentage of the health care spending budget- in fact, only 8% goes to physicians. Here's a link to a research study done by Jackson Healthcare system (<a href=\"http://www.jacksonhealthcare.com/media-room/news/md-salaries-as-percent-of-costs/)\" title=\"http://www.jacksonhealthcare.com/media-room/news/md-salaries-as-percent-of-costs/)\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.jacksonhealthcare.com/media-room/news/md-salaries-as-percent-...</a>. So Mr. Holahan needs to do his homework before making broad stroke statements. <br/><br/>Two, this article fails to acknowledge the fact that obtaining a US medical degree is a personal endeavor- students PAY for their degrees. Most medical school's are averaging cost of attendance's of 70-80k per year. Considering medical school is four years long, by the time most students finish school they have the equivalent of a home mortgage in loans. Now imagine ~360k debt + 3-7 years of residency training being paid 45-65k + interest on that 360k at 6.8%. <br/><br/>Other countries such as France that have successful single payer systems (France actually has a private insurance system too) pay for their medical student's education as well as provide them with a stipend. Additionally, physicians in France pay less tax than the general public. <br/><br/>Don't you think that most US medical students would take up an offer for free tuition + stipend if they make the equivalent of their single payer counterparts? They would (with the exception of students interested in traditionally high paying specialties such as Dermatology).  ",

				"commentBody": "The arguments against doctors' salaries miss many points:<br/><br/>1) Doctor's salaries are only a small part of the costs.  Doctor's salaries are only about 8% of healthcare spending. Even were we to not pay doctors at all, the cost \"savings\" would be gone only in a few years based on average rate of rise of health care spending. Cutting doctor's salaries in half as the article alludes to would only give us a 4% savings which would be gone in 2 years.<br/><br/>2) Real incomes of doctors have been stagnant for a decade and for many, have DECREASED. Therefore, this is not the cause of the rising costs. To make doctors the scape goat is unjustified.<br/><br/>3) Opportunity cost- with between 11 and 17 years of post-high school education, longer hours than the average American could even imaging and with a group of individuals who would be very compeitive for other jobs, doctors have a very  high opportunity cost to go into medicine. Add to this the lost family time and the opportunity cost is even higher. For instance I haven't been home for Christmas in 3 years. I haven't made a Thanksgiving in 5.  This is just a fact of the job in the US that most dont realize. Hospitals don't close. <br/><br/>4) Stress- there are few jobs that deal with life and death situations and this wears on a person. <br/><br/>If you want to cut salaries, don't expect to have the quality of candidates going into medical school.

This is a story of a pretty model type who is taken advantage of by a skeezy rich old man.  She wouldn't have been at the party if she wasn't pretty and she wouldn't have been with him if he wasn't rich. She's scared now that he might attack her now, like he does all women who speak truthfully about him?  Maybe.  There are dozens of interview in here about women who worked with him, by him, some who admire and a lot that don't.  The article was enlightening, specially the story on Ivana's assault, how he criticized and humiliated the pageant contestants.  Without even reading the article, I already knew that he takes advantage of women, humiliates women, mentors a few (woo hoo he's a secret angel!) but his track record is clear. I wouldn't want my kids anywhere near this sexist, racist, ignorant pompous man.  I am eagerly awaiting his defeat.",

Of course the liberals will say that she was forced to or paid to or whatever- because they want and need as much ammunition as possible. Of course this is a hit piece. Just read the title. Yes he WAS a playboy. He admits it. It doesn't mean he is one now. Where was the outcry from the left when Clinton was engaging in all of his playboy activities? Even during his political reign? Nope- we all were supposed to be tolerant and forgiving- after all- that was his private life- and who hasn't screwed up?  It's a double standard that the left seems blind to.",

I warn you. Mark my words. The more you pander to the queen, the more you are being obvious and the more people are losing their respect for you all - The NYT, MS NBC, FOX, CNN have become ridiculous.<br/><br/>This was so evident that you were trying to buttress the woman card argument for Mrs Clinton by making Mr. Trump look bad. And it has back-fired so badly that two respected journalists end up looking pathetic.<br/><br/>How about a piece on Mr. Clinton? <br/><br/>I hope Sanders runs as a third party candidate - he has such a great chance of winning.",

				"commentBody": "Ms Lane's current comments are not crucial to my opinion &amp; understanding of Trump's repulsive behavior toward women. She is not arguing whether or not he did these things, just how it should be interpreted, right? His ex-wife also disavows that he raped her, which I highly suspect is at least partly because she does not want to be raked over the coals by Trump &amp; his followers, and so many clueless misogynists who don't believe that a married woman can be raped by her husband. Not to mention, that she'd not just be going against any rich &amp; powerful man, but the Republican contender for President, and her own daughter who's campaigning for him. <br/><br/>The women who experienced Trump's actions can provide all kinds of excuses. We know though, his thoughts &amp; actions are sexist and damaging to women. The best he can say about women in the work-place is that we may be efficient and productive in the best possible case, but only bc we have something to prove. This is clearly NOT supporting women. It's creating and relying on a sexist environment and using women to work harder than any man just to gain some respect &amp; keep their jobs. It's sick. We err by relying on what women in his orbit say publicly. They have a right to their own interpretation &amp;/or to do damage control. But their stories show a man who objectifies and hurts women as a matter of course. Just one more reason he is a complete horror show.",
