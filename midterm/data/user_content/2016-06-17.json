Then he started whistling his s's  as he spoke, like an old timey affectation.  I used to listen occasionally because they sometimes had great musical guests on the show.  But once he started deliberately making the geezer noises, I stopped listening.<br/>Still, I will never forget my favorite Keillor joke from years ago:  \"George Bush says he wants to put a man on the moon.  (Perfect pause)   So do I.\"  ",

This omission continued well after most news sites were referring to the fact that the club clearly and readily bills itself as a gay club on its home page on FB. I found the omission very odd.

A \"straight\" club wouldn't be so-labeled. Labeling a club as gay at one time would be used solely to titillate the public, as clickbait - offensive.<br/><br/>Once it was suspected  that this was a reason these people were targeted, it was a part of the story.

				"commentBody": "Glad to see this type of classic modus operandi from China is now finally widely published in the international press. All Taiwanese young and old are used to seeing this type of petty shenanigans from China, whether it be government officials or civilian. Have you heard of the one where an entire busload of Chinese basketball team forfeiting a game because en route to a collegiate game they saw Taiwanese flags flying? What about the time when Chinese journalists stormed the stage of a video game championship because the Taiwanese kids were waving Taiwanese flags. Then there's the educators that walked out of an international conference because their Taiwanese counterparts were using Taiwan on their name cards. What about the Chinese students protesting the inclusion of Team Taiwan in Harvard's Model UN? Don't forget the Chinese diplomat that protested to the state department because some Oregon restaurant painted a pro Taiwan mural.  My trip to the zoo is interrupted to report graffiti drawing in Taiwan as part of China on a map next to the panda exhibit. When traveling I had to call to get a travel site to change the silly \"Chinese Taipei\" to Taiwan. I even had to endure staredowns from the Chinese booth in my kid's elementary school multicultural night.<br/><br/>The above is the essence of being Taiwanese, and it just makes us more adamant of our Taiwanese identity. And these 50 kids will be no different, their Taiwanese identity is now solidly engraved in their hearts and minds.",

Laws will always be broken, but clearly that shouldn't mean that we just don't bother having laws. Having them is ultimately better for society than not. <br/><br/>It may be a valid point that even in countries where gun ownership is outlawed people can still find a way to get a gun. It's also very clear from widely available statistics that the U.S. has many, many more mass shootings than any other advanced country where guns are banned, even when the population difference is accounted for.<br/><br/>This implies that if the U.S. make it more difficult for people to own guns there would be much fewer mass shootings.

The American people should stand up against it, particularly those Republicans who are not speaking out about the evil he represents. My thoughts go to Ms Cox's family at this terrible time. She obviously was a very decent person. As for Dom's comment that the vehicles for much of Trump's invective are owned by Rupert Murdoch, Australian born billionaire, that's true, but he is now a US citizen, a financial migrant. I used to work for Murdoch in Australia in the 1960s. His womanizing amoral future was  emerging then.  Murdoch's just another (albeit more successful) Donald Trump, a man who flew on his father's coat tails. The difference is that Sir Keith Murdoch, his father, would be ashamed of him.",
