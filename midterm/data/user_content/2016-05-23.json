I feel punched in the heart, unable to articulate what I'm thinking.<br/><br/>However, my theory that all the direwolves have to die for the Starks to be reunited and take control again is slowly, sadly becoming true. All the signs point to it. Nymeria and Ghost are the only ones left (if Shaggydog really is dead).",

				"commentBody": "Does anyone else see a strange and chilling parallel between Euron and Trump?  Both have done all kinds of stuff other than lead, but now insist with a maniacal gleam in their eyes that they are the only true leader... yikes. And Euron's focus on the physical - eerie same thing with Trump. The GoT writers are on to something there - how will that end?  Sad to say bye to Max von Sydow's character and Bran's direwolf - they did not have much screentime, but made up for that with force of character. The strange running away of Yara and Theon Greyjoy mirrors the scattering of the Stark children - can't any family stay together on this show? But this episode will be remembered for Hodor's story - so tragic. We will miss him - as we miss the brave and the true. As we will miss Jorah, unless he does that that elusive cure. They are both too good for this wicked, twisted world. How we wish Melisandre had some magic for both of them. Now, how will Bran escape the White Walkers at his heels? Has the Raven taught him enough, and does he have enough powers to survive? There is nothing between him and a terrible end but snow - and whatever power he possesses. ",

				"commentBody": "Last week when Danny walked out of the burning building, it reminded me of the liquid metal Terminator walking through fire in T2.  This week the scene between Danny and Ser Jorah reminded me the ending of that movie, where the young John Connor desperately tried to prevent the death of T-800: \u201cNo!  It'll be okay! I command you not to die! I order you not to die...\u201d<br/><br/>The music during that scene was just perfect.  And good for Ser Jorah, finally learned his lesson and came clean about a secret that could cost him his place with Danny.  He deserved to be cured like Shireen.<br/><br/>I naively thought that\u2019d be the most bitter-sweet/tragic scene of the episode. Then we lost Summer.  Then Hordor.<br/><br/>Let me get this straight: the Three-Eyed Raven takes Bran into the past, just so that poor child can be caught in this mind-controll mobius time loop, becoming Hordor, so one day in the future he can be used to help Bran?!<br/>This is one of the most emotionally devastating thing ever on this show.  This somehow felt way worse than Ned's death.  Poor Wyllis, yet another collateral damage in the game of thrones.  There are no small parts Hordor.  We will miss you greatly.",

							"commentBody": "That's the time travel paradox.  It's true, Hordor was already Hordor before Bran got his powers (perhaps even before Bran was born). <br/><br/>So Hordor's transformation took place in the past when the future Bran, with his new powers, went to the past.  <br/><br/>That doesn't mean anything goes.  In the GoT world, it seems that if you go back into the past and interfere in any way, it is sort of 'meant to be', i.e. that altered past is what make the present (Hordor being with them, saving them) possible.<br/><br/>Last night I was trying to figure out if the Three-Eyed Raven leading Bran to Winterfell in the past as the White Walkers are barging in meant he can see the future.  My conclusion was he doesn't have to:  <br/><br/>He has seen everything in the past - how Hordor being Hordor helped Bran fled Winterfell and everything after that lead to this day.  He of course also saw himself and Bran making Hordor who he is in the past.  So he doesn't really have to know the future by seeing it directly - by seeing what they did on their time travel to the past, he could infer the future - when and how he would die in the future, and that his successor would be Bran, and what he had to do to save Bran...",

							"commentBody": "Actually, Jeff, there's a whole component of the transportation system that disappeared starting in the 40s, which explains the glaring gaps in outer-borough service. There used to be an extensive network of streetcars service Queens and Brooklyn. Those lines were bought out by Standard Oil, GM, and Firestone, which shut them down one by one. They wanted people to drive or take buses, both of which increased demand for their products. During the same time frame, additional elevated subway lines were also decommissioned. This is why we're hurting now. <br/><br/>Surface congestion is too bad to permit resurrection of streetcars, but elevated additions to the subway line would be a relatively easy and cheap way of increasing the network quickly. New train stock runs much more quietly than even the newest trains we have on the rails now. NIMBYs are going to have to be denied--we need more trains or the system will break. ",

For that service pattern to return the MTA has to install a switch near Kings Hwy that was removed years ago. With all the large apartment complexes being constructed at the southern end of the 'F' the MTA needs to consider adding more trains in the next few years. ",

I figured I had the genes that would keep me safe. This was despite the fact that over the last 25 years, I had gained 60 lbs, didn't exercise enough, had borderline high blood pressure, was at the upper limit of \"safe\" cholesterol levels. In other words, I had multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease.  My GP would tell me each year at my annual physical to lose weight &amp; get more exercise.  And I didn't do anything about it.  I kidded myself into thinking I was eating healthy.  I had plenty of salads, ate plenty of fish and poultry &amp; didn't eat red meat, &amp; ate plenty of fruit.  But I also used bottled salad dressing &amp; pre-cooked turkey on those salads.  I ate canned fish, \"diet\" ice cream bars &amp; boxed breakfast cereal;  just way too much processed food.  I also ate out a lot.  Well, when I got out of the hospital in April, I started scrutinizing what I had been eating, &amp; really read the labels &amp; did the math. I was shocked at the amounts of sugar &amp; salt I was eating in the processed foods that made up half of my diet.  And finally, because I had almost died, &amp; was looking at a dramatically shortened life as a result of my heart attack, I have started paying attention.   As others have said in their comments, the key is getting back to natural food &amp; cooking it yourself.  I'm doing that now and feel so much better.",

As for the cost, I do not know how low income people can afford all this prepared food.  Frozen dinners are not cheap at all especially compared with how much it would cost to make the same thing at home.  They're all starch based (super cheap, readily available), frozen vegetables, and some ground beef or bits of chicken.  All that stuff is readily available at any grocery store. How long does it take to fill a pot with water and turn on the stove?  chopped meats can actually be cooked in a microwave and so can the frozen vegetables.  Pasta with chicken and mixed vegetables can be cooked at home in 15 minutes.  In ten minutes you can have a baked potato stuffed with vegetables and smothered in grated cheese.  Tuna casserole can be assembled in no time, cooked on Sunday night and reheated for Tuesday dinner in three minutes. A big pot of rice and beans in the fridge can be adapted to many inexpensive tasty meals in minutes. Take turns cleaning up the cooking pots and let everyone wash their own bowl and glass.  Bingo. It takes a little organizing and forethought but it's pretty simple.  Agreed some neighborhoods don't have great shopping resources but any market carries basic ingredients like rice, beans, frozen vegetables, cans of tuna and so forth. \"td\" was a bit harsh and frustrated but speaks truth.",

I'd say \"some white people have given up in disgust at the violence in black communities\" but they are NOT doing so out of racism (many are liberals) and all of them are horrified at the violence depicted in this article. Nobody wants to live in an city where large areas are \"no go zones\" for white people (as is the case in my hometown, or Detroit, or many other large older cities).<br/><br/>If you have a brilliant plan for making \"guns less available\" to JUST poor black men -- without violating the Constitution -- please let us know what it is. Cities like NYC and Chicago and the whole state of California have draconian gun laws for just this reason. How's that working out?",
