				"commentBody": "At first I thought this writer was going to deliver a back handed compliment to Romney and a sarcastic denunciation of Giuliani. Little did I know they were actually serious. According to this writer, Romney is to be disqualified simply because of his pre-election disapproval, \"laced with venom\" of Mr. Trump. By this measure there are approximately three people who could be in the general cabinet pool and none of them are Rodolfo Giuliani. One advantage of Romney is that he is a proven negotiator. He is essentially a self made man through his wheeler-dealer days at Bain. No such negotiating experience for Rodolfo. His style has always been the \"my way or the highway\" approach. Romney' skills might best be used in reforming so called Obamacare. If they are really to do the honest thing, they'll say they've done a root and branch overhaul when in reality they simply change the name to Romney-Care. Rodolfo would best if he were put in charge of developing a national policy on the mentally ill who roam our streets. His first hand knowledge of this problem. Anywhere but State would be an improvement. Imagine his first speech to the UN if it resembled his RNC Convention speech at all. He could handle planning the first Putin love fest but not much more.",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>.<br/>Rudolph Giuliani was United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.<br/><br/>In his various forays into electoral politics, he was elected Mayor of New York twice. His accomplishments in that office included arranging for sidewalk railings that keep pedestrians from stepping off the curb except in designated places. They also prevent bicycles and cars from driving onto the sidewalk, as is sometimes necessary in an emergency.<br/><br/>Mayor Giuliani's second term was coming to an end, his successor had been elected, and he tried to get others to agree to prolong his term rather than handing over the office to the winner of the election.<br/><br/>When the federal Department of Homeland Security was formed, Mr. Giuliani was asked to recommend someone to be its first leader. The person he recommended, Bernard Kerik, had committed felonies while serving in City government during Giuliani's mayoralty. (Giuliani made his recommendation before the prosecution had begun, but it seems likely he had looked at Kerik's public service closely enough to know about the criminal behavior.) Rather than becoming a Cabinet Secretary, Kerik became a federal inmate.<br/><br/>If these incidents are insufficient to establish that Giuliani is lacking in judgment, we can also look to the instances when he tried to have his mistress attend official events at Gracie Mansion while Giuliani's wife and children were in the residence. And, of course, he screams nonstop.<br/><br/>Giuliani must not be entrusted with high office.",

South America sends half their teams, Europe about 1 in 4 (including San Marino, Andorra, Faeroe Islands and now Gibraltar among the minnows)<br/>It's not that FIFA has made it easy for the US. With 3.5 spots available, only Oceania has less, with reason.<br/>Even Mexico struggled for the 2014 qualification, having to go the playoff route. Then again, for 2010, Uruguay was the last team in, a 2-1 aggregate over Costa Rica to get there, and they made the semifinals. I really don't se the argument how FIFA made it easy for the US. Sort of not the US' fault that they're in with dreadful Canada, and the Jamaicas, T&amp;Ts, Costa Ricas and Honduras of the world. <br/><br/>In what way would you make qualifying for the US more fair?",

				"commentBody": "I don't perceive Kristof's compassionate attitude as condoning the harm these women inflict on their children or on society.  So while I agree that journalists have a duty to verify the stories of those they interview, I don't believe it's fair to require that he verify stories if there is no existing record that these women suffered abuse.  It's important to realize that so many abuse survivors do not have their \"day in court\".  Perhaps they may not have told anyone about the abuse or their circumstances.  They may have told but were not believed.  Regardless, there is plenty of evidence proving that abused children suffer trauma and injury that often impedes their ability to make healthy, \"sane\" decisions.  Those children become adults who make up a huge portion of the prison population.<br/>As I reflect on the comments made by those who insinuate that these women fabricated stories about past abuse, I acknowledge that perhaps these readers don't know anyone who experienced life-altering abuse who didn't receive appropriate help that could have changed the course of their lives.   Perhaps these readers are unaware that they do know abuse survivors.  I wonder what makes these readers so confident that they would make better decisions had they experienced the same level of violence and dysfunction in their formative years that these women claim to have suffered.<br/>Above all, I wonder what makes some people so uncomfortable with a humane corrections system.

				"commentBody": "The brief mention of \"Elena of Avalor\" and the suggestion that it's a half-hearted effort or \"concession\" by Disney shows no understanding of the company's Disney Junior channel and the cost and marketing behind it. Launching an computer-animated TV show, while not as intricate or detailed as a Disney feature such as \"Moana\" or \"Finding Dory,\" is a hefty cost greater than a number of studio movies. Disney advertised and hyped this series for months, put care and thought into the stories and characters and felt so confident by its success that Elena displays were at the front of Disney Stores nationwide even before the show premiered. Go on Disney's website now and Elena merch is hyped more than almost any other. Best of all, it's a lovely, affecting show that is loved by girls and boys of all backgrounds, including my three-year-old daughter (not a Latina) who wrote her Santa list today. Elena's dazzling red dress was the only item on it. (Until we prodded her a bit, nudging her towards gifts Santa had already purchased. :) The writer does the progressive \"Elena of Avalon\" a disservice but not appreciating, or knowing, the full impact of the program.",

				"commentBody": "As someone who has to take lactase supplements to digest dairy products and Beano to digest vegetables, as well as someone who becomes ill after eating scallops, I only wish I weren't special in those ways, and would prefer not to disclose my problems to others. At restaurants, where the menus often list most or all of the ingredients, I discreetly reach into my purse for the supplements just before digging into the food, and I avoid certain types of food (e.g., dairy whey additives and seafood that may have been contaminated by scallops) entirely.  I am so grateful that I don't have a possibly deadly peanut allergy or diagnosed celiac disease, but I and others do have to know what is in the foods we consume, because these problems are not just a a conceit for us, but a fact of life. It's not the same as someone deciding that he or she wishes to be a vegetarian or a vegan or concluding, without medical testing for confirmation, that he or she is intolerant of gluten, although I respect those choices and always try to accommodate them, too, at my table.",

Already we the citizenry are grasping at potential nominees who are not as utterly awful as many seen paraded in front of the trump country club or the NYC golden trump tower or wherever they're summoned....<br/><br/>Already (and still), I am girding my loins against this rising tide of \"normalizing\" this man who is calling himself president, and his merry band of ideologue sycophants masquerading as knowledgeable statespersons. Part of my fading shock is morphing into a keen awareness of the fact that this man seems to be determined on dismantling our country as we know it. And in no small way. We have never had a president with such myopic goals at self enrichment (ALL the money? Bannon's love?) coupled with such contempt for the law. OUR laws, the things that make this country work!! And he is already stating they do not apply to him....<br/><br/>All aflutter at the opportunity, cabinet applicants arrive to audition for this man, not yet in office, who is showing his true determination in the role...could he be the world's first trillionaire? Is this what he means by \"running America like one of my businesses\"?<br/><br/>But back to planet Earth: NOT my president, not my ally, not America's protector. I will not back down and I will not shut up. No conscientious American should allow OUR country to be sold off!!",
