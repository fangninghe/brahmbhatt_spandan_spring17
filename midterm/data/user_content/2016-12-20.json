				"commentBody": "I'm trying hard to not get caught up in the red vs. blue battle that seems to be raging in our country, which I see as mostly a ploy of the rich elite to distract us from the fact that they are robbing us blind. However, I don't see the electoral college issue as a red vs blue affair-it's really more a matter of basic fairness, and this article does a nice job of addressing this matter. Getting rid of the electoral college is something that should have been done long ago, but is especially important now given voting demographics, which seem increasingly likely to result in a Republican president-elect with only a minority of the popular vote. Unfortunately, probably the only way this can happen is if we can get enough states to join the National Popular Vote interstate compact. The states with outsized voting power (e.g., Wyoming) will never agree to give up this power, and the beneficiaries of the electoral college voting system (Republicans) will also never go along with this, so a constitutional amendment is never going to work. Are there still enough blue states to make the National Popular Vote interstate compact relevant? Are republicans now so much in control that they can effectively ensure this is a non-issue?",

				"commentBody": "Actually, Robert, undocumented people are not here \"illegally,\" as it is not a federal crime to be in the US in violation of federal immigration laws. Congress considered making undocumented presence in the US a felony in 2005, but declined to do so.  Instead, undocumented presence is a civil matter that can lead to deportation through proceedings before immigration courts. The problem is that, through indefinite detention, we have created a de facto system of criminal punishment (without any of the Constitutional protections we provide in actual criminal contexts) for civil matters that often do not end up leading to deportation. Such a system is clearly unjust.<br/><br/>About 2/3rds of the undocumented immigrants in the US entered legally and, therefore, have not committed any crime. The other 1/3 entered illegally, but under federal law, doing so is only a misdemeanor unless they had been previously deported or removed from the US and then came back illegally (in which case, they can receive up to 2 years in prison). <br/><br/>So, in the large majority of cases, the rhetoric about \"illegal\" immigrants is entirely false. In most other cases, it is vastly overstated, as we typically do not consider committing a misdemeanor some massive issue.<br/><br/>Do we need to improve the immigration system in the US? Certainly. But scapegoating people with false and overwrought claims of criminal behavior is a horrible way to do so.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive/\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive/</a>",

If you read what their review, you can tell that they've only seen the trailer at best.  I can't understand why this movie is getting so much bad press.  I watched it this weekend and I absolutely loved it.  The jokes were funny.  The emotional parts were definitely heart felt and authentic.  The acting was amazing. And the script was one of the best I've seen this year.  Just for perspective, I went to see Star Wars: Rouge One the night before I watched this.  Collateral Beauty is much more entertaining.  I actually wanted to see it again once I left the theater.  Star Wars on the other hand almost put me to sleep.  Mind you, I'm a huge Star Wars fan.  I've never seen such an aggressive attempt to sabotage a film before in my life.  Every major publication trashed this film.  Meanwhile, every review about Star Wars: Rogue One has been nothing less than a celebration.  Fact is, Rogue One has more characters than a Donald Trump tweet.  The script has very few emotions and lacks any sense of urgency.  Pay no attention these reviews.   Go see Collateral Beauty for yourself.  You be the judge. ",

There's plenty of class+gender subtext here -- some of it subtly portraying white advantage, much of it showing the wounds of class. Very well acted, well-written and with an unexpected turn in the corner, a wrenching scene near the end that is devastating+oddly not even hinted at in the review. Also, to call the kid's loss of his father at 16 and left w/o a parent at home, is not \"manageable.\" ",
