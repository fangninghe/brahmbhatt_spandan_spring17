				"commentBody": "I make blueberry cobbler far more often than pie (just ate a bowl of cobbler this evening, in fact), but I always use flour as a thickener and my filling never tastes of flour. I do add either lime zest or lemon zest to the berries, so perhaps that adds enough dimension to the flavor to get past any raw flour taste -- some blueberries can taste a bit flat by themselves. I'm sure the arrowroot starch is more effective at firming everything up, but I don't like that thick, gelled texture. I want the berries a bit runny. I may tweak the pur\u00e9e and stovetop thickening, though, without the arrowroot. Maybe cook it down to concentrate it?",

For my last pie, I heaped in four or five types with some lemon juice, a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg, sugar but not too much, and cornstarch plus flour to thicken (not prethickened) into a pre-made (go ahead, hate me) Trader Joe's crust, which I latticed on top, glazed with milk and sprinkled with sugar. Results: the filling fell, leaving a sorry empty dome, but the outer crust was perfect and the flavors incredible with many distinct layers. If it were a painting, it would be a Matisse? Those who ate some raved and were intent on mixing blueberry varieties on their next go. Caveats; juice ran a lot even after cooling, and the inner crust got a little puddingy. Next time I'll prebake. TJ's crust is awesome, and I've handmade various other types (so. much. work.). TJ's competes and is more supple and less, em, gamy than mainstream brands. Next time I'll try prethickening the filling, even though it seems like a crime. Give and take your imperfections seems to be the theme...",

				"commentBody": "A late relative used to make a great blueberry pie by shaking the berries in a bag with flour and sugar, dumping them into a pie shell and then pouring whole milk over them. It actually worked - an instant  blueberry cream pie.<br/><br/>This year I used Dorie Greenspan's tips for filling: macerate the berries a while with a half a cup of sugar. Taste how sweet and observe how juicy the berries are and add more sugar if necessary and increase the amount of flour if they seem especially juicy. Also sprinkle fine dried breadcrumbs on the bottom of the crust. It turned out very good. This year's berries were great. Makes up for no local peaches this year.",

				"commentBody": "I have been baking pies and cakes for over 45 years. Blueberry is my all-time favorite, and I've made a few already this season.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, here's my recipe:<br/><br/>2 pints of blueberries sweetened with half a cup of sugar, flour (less than a quarter cup) as a thickener, dash of cinnamon and some lemon juice. Let that sit for at least an hour to sweeten.<br/><br/>Crust: 2 cups unbleached flour, tsp. salt, 2/3 cup Crisco (cut into flour with pastry blender until crumbly), approx. 1/2 cup cold water added gradually and blended in with fork.<br/><br/>Roll out bottom crust, fill with BB, top with 4 pats of butter, cover with top crust. Bake at 325 deg. for 30 min. Raise oven temp to 450 and bake for approx. 25-30 min.<br/><br/>Enjoy!",

				"commentBody": "With all due respect to Miriam Foster, I actually like the taste of flour in the blueberry filling. She is right: it does taste like flour. But that's a hearty, wholesome counterpoint to the sweet, fruity overtones of the filling. I suppose I am fond of that flavor because my mother sprinkled whole wheat flour over the blueberries in her pies. At the time, I thought there was nothing more glorious! I guess it's hard to beat nostalgia when it comes to comfort foods.    ",

				"commentBody": "Blueberry pies are one of my favourite childhood memories. I grew up in a mining town surrounded by fields which, in season, were blue with wild blueberries. They were small, dark and very sweet. My father and I would pick them after dinner and my mother, who was from a large French-Canadian family and could make masterpieces from just about any food, would make pies. She used her usual crust, with some openings on top, and just the blueberries and sugar as the filling. Mmmmm! I assume that the secret to her perfect pies was those small, dark, sweet and very fresh wild blueberries, but maybe it was love.",

When I'm here at my cabin in the Woods that's often due to necessity - not invention. I bought what looked like a lot of blueberries at the farmers market but realized a pie filling needs to be really mounded up before baking. So I added an almost equal quantity of diced rhubarb and then couldn't  resist grating a little fresh ginger into the mix. Behold! The portmanteau pie - Bluebarb! God, it's good!",
