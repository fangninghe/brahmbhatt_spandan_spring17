				"commentBody": "The bourgeois travel birds, coming home to roost. Commenters in these pages scoffed at the rare (mine included) hard criticism of wanton international travel when the Zika microcephaly first hit our news cycles. This is not like bed bugs, Lyme Disease, or West Nile Virus even. To the scoffers, everyone who criticized the arrogant, even reckless travel urges during Ebola, was part racist part doofus, and the rest tin foil anti-vaxers and such. But growing up, there were many restrictions on travel and agricultural products for very good reasons! Those are all gone by the wayside as it impacts travel industry, airlines, and the wanton ooze of humanity flowing through the borders and climate zones. No one has much been exposed to what these babies with microcephaly look like. Anyone daring enough to hunt for the photos really should. It is really quite shocking, and international travel is spreading the issue to the unborn worldwide. Aside from the startling appearance of infants with incurably tiny heads, the disabilities and challenges for these children and their families and communities is devastating. Are y'all still going to be scoffing at that?",

				"commentBody": "Affordable child care is a good idea that undoubtedly would free up countless women for more challenging and lucrative jobs, and some men to boot. This assumes, of course, that the challenging and lucrative jobs are there to be exploited, which, given 1% growth projected as far as the eye can see, is an open question.<br/><br/>But I\u2019m losing count of the sheer number of really neat ideas Dems come up with for a better society that require either dramatically higher taxes or greater levels of debt.<br/><br/>Well, we want universal \u201cMedicare for all\u201d; we want free college and pre-school for all kids; we want to substantially increase Social Security benefits; we\u2019re batting around the idea of providing a \u201cguaranteed income\u201d to every American -- and let\u2019s not forget our 11-30 million \u201cundocumented but welcome guests\u201d; we want vastly expanded subsidized housing; and never to be forgotten is easing the transition from a carbon-based economy to one reliant on cleaner energy, which unfortunately will cost jobs, such as the destruction of the coal industry.<br/><br/>Then, there\u2019s the whole litany of lesser needs, such as expanded SNAP allotments and layering-on more regulation of business to make its predations less onerous on regular people.<br/><br/>Republicans might even go for some of these ideas as worthy. But even assuming higher taxes, how many times are Dems going to spend the same tax dollar increase on their endless litany of good ideas?<br/><br/>Are any of you bothering to run numbers on what ALL this would cost?",

So, in that sense, this is like Ebola, SARS and bird flu, we cannot treat it. However, this is not Ebola in the sense that Ebola often has over 50% fatality rate while Zika is often non-fatal. The main danger of Zika is causing birth defect in unborn babies. It is a major concern as Zika is likely to spread and will affect couples who are planning to have babies. With global warming and the hospitability of many parts of the country to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, it is likely a major health challenge.",

In the boroughs, my understanding is the infected are returning from Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico from their summer visits to family and homeland. And these have been the original source for reports of transmission from infected female to uninfected male, is my understanding.",

Donald, however, thought that his presence was really so valuable that Louisiana had to pull rescuers off to provide him with security. Reminds me of the last election, where a candidate went to a soup kitchen to wash clean pots for a photo op.",

				"commentBody": "We spend 1% of health care dollars on public health, but only public health can stop an epidemic from shutting down a country or state.  No doubt, millionaire Republican Governor Rick Scott nickel and dimed public health asking their health dept to do more with less.  Now, caught with an underfunded department, they are about to experience what happens when public health is asked to play catch up while tourism tanks and pregnant women and families flee the area.  Add to the misery a federal government that could not even vote on a Zika response bill before going on a several month summer vacation.  <br/><br/>Pathetic is too kind a word.",
