Such dire consequences predicted by allowing concealed carry have been common fare almost three decades.   The recurring fact that none of these dreadful predictions come to pass hasn\u2019t dissuaded the prognosticators in the least.   Check the comments a few years back when these same commenters were offering the same thing about allowing concealed carry in our National Forrest.",

After decades of years with politicians who bow to the will of their Wall Street donors, it's good to see someone who has some fire to them, along with Bernie Sanders. I am SICK of the establishment. How long will it take them to realize this?<br/><br/>The pivotal point in regards to this election is whether WE the electorate are willing to take a chance with an outsider. If we don't- when will be the next time we get an opportunity to revolutionize the political system? Do you think party leaders are going to loosen their grip and allow insurgents to run their party? NO! We either fight back this year or my generation and I are ruined for decades to come of a corrupt system that masquerades a form of democracy that is nonexistent.<br/><br/>Please, it is either Sanders or Trump. We have to start somewhere to change the system. I KNOW they are not perfect but, the establishment scares me more than them.",

Instead Goldman senior management got HUGE government funded bonuses by way fo stock options that went way up from the Fed Reserve funds pumped into Goldman.<br/><br/>Obama should really reconsider what his biggest mistake was. We the People didn't get our crumbling infrastructure repaired that would have created lots of jobs; underwater homeowners never got their mortgages reset as promised by the Big Banks &amp; foreclosures using fraudulent documents were allowed to proceed on a wholesale basis. But Obama made sure the shareholders of the Big Banks kept their equity &amp; their management got bonuses. Obama even insisted that no reforms be imposed upon the Financial Sector when they would have had to agree to any conditions asked just to survive<br/><br/>So Obama got what he wanted, the Tea Party, Radical Republicans &amp; lost the House &amp; Senate ergo no legislation after Obama gave us National RomneyCare in which anyone not willfully blind can see the horrible problems of a healthcare plan birthed in a Republican think tank-too large co-pays &amp; deductibles so that insureds have \"skin in the game\"<br/><br/>So Thank you Obama for once again performing for Wall Street; you never delivered what you promised &amp; could have delivered when you had a Democratic majority in Congress. Vast numbers of the Little People will continue to suffer from your sell out to Wall St long after you're gone",

That has been the problem since day one of the economic collapse: what these shadow bankers did was NOT illegal or criminal.  It was gambling, it was stupid, it was risk taking with other people's money and only the extent of the actions make it anything out of the ordinary for the capitalist system.  The Dodd-Frank Bill seeks to make illegal and criminalize at least some of these actions, and that is why Republicans are so anxious to weaken or get rid of it.  Their bread is mostly buttered on the business side, not the worker side.",
