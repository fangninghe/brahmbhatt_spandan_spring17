				"commentBody": "The economy isn't bustling, but it is growing, slowly and steadily.  The entire planet is undergoing economic malaise.  Growth rates are down all over the planet.  The US economy is one of the strongest around.  Other major nations are so weak, they have negative interest rates.    <br/><br/>Oh but you see, Trump is a wealthy businessman so he knows how to run our economy.  Trump is very good at using other people's money, not paying what he owes, using the bankruptcy laws to his advantage, and skirting taxes.  Drug lords have lots of money.  That doesn't mean they should be president.<br/><br/>Then there is the rehash of trickle down economics.  Mr. Trump, why don't you propose that people that make over one million pay no taxes?  Then there will be even more money that trickles down into the pockets of working class people.  If a little trickling is good, why isn't a flood of trickling better?  Do the same for the big corporations.  Eliminate taxes on only the SP500 companies.  I'm sure none of that money will bypass the workers and go to the shareholders.  Don't bother with the small companies.  Not enough money there to trickle down.   <br/><br/>So Trump, don't hold back.  Go all the way.  We need more trickling.  It's worked so well so far, that it has created millions of struggling, disenfranchised voters who flock to you for more of the same.  Tell them that we just need more time and more trickling.  The GOP leadership will back you on this one.    ",

All this with GOP Congress to work with.<br/><br/>Obama did get the unemployment below the 6% by 2014 without any cooperation from Congress. I guess this little nugget is telling the whole story, not only that Obama's economy is best under the circumstances, but also another argument than on average democratic presidents are much better (by a substantial margin) in handling the national economy.",

Don\"t feel bad for him!  <br/><br/>This piece is a nice bit of fluff, but I have searched in vain on the NYTimes site for some report of the forged letter purportedly sent to Mrs. Clinton by Sen. Tom Carper, now being investigated by officials including the FBI. This is a story that was put out by Reuters, after Sen. Carper submitted the fake letter to the authorities. It's ironic the FBI is part of the investigations since there has been other reports about their rogue behavior, including their closeness to Rudy Giulliani. So much intrigue and nastiness out there!  WaPo has reported also. I'm interested in the Times' take on this but unable to locate it. ",
