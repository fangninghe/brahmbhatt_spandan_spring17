They dont realize that illegal immigrants are doing their carpentry, and that there are many legal immigrant and citizen carpenters that have been put out of buisiness. <br/><br/>They want people to have higher wages and protection from exploitation, but then want to make sure we have illegal immigrants to pick their lettuce so their Whole Foods bill doesnt become even more astronomical. <br/><br/>I find it confusing to day the least, and at the most hypocritical.

She knows this is about confidence in reported results, and with the recent Russian hacking events, a nice paper trail recount would help. I donated to the recount effort, and apparently so did a lot of other people in a very short time frame.  My husband and I lived and voted in Florida for the 2000 election, my husband voted on a black box machine that kept flipping his Gore choice to Bush on the screen.  The poll workers would not let him switch to another machine, insisted he vote on that machine even though it still kept saying W, and refused to take that machine out of commission. <br/><br/>So yeah it matters. Maybe this recount won't be shut down like in 2000.  It is worth the money, time and effort to a lot of people like myself who know voting machines and systems can and do fail, and can be hacked. Let's find out. ",

Put into question the outcome of the election in sufficient close-count states to make it impossible to make the Constitution's deadline for the Electoral College to meet and cast their votes.  Remember, these are based on the election results in each state with little chance to persuade electors to switch.  Without a result from the EC, the decision as to President falls to the House of Representatives.  Sure, it's Republican controlled but they aren't bound in any particular way to the election vote count at state level and some might be persuaded by the national popular vote - it would not take all that many Republican \"defections\" to get a majority assuming the Democrats can actually stick together.  And there is where the pressure will be applied to go against allowing Donald Trump to move into the White House despite the EC results - all constitutional.<br/><br/>Take that, Founding Fathers!",

I'm sorry to hear about kids tethered to computers, doing rote lessons there--that sounds like they (or their parents?) may be attempting to duplicate a typical public-school curriculum approach at home, which is the antithesis of what every homeschool family I've met has done with the ever-expanding world of options available to them, even those with limited financial resources.

The reason Bruce Arena lost his job after 2006 was that he was exposed as being completely out of his depth against good international competition. Managing in a second-tier league is not likely to have sharpened his skills.<br/><br/>At this stage, the USMNT should not have a domestic-based manager. It's just that simple. Bob Bradley, who was also overmatched internationally, is getting his lunch eaten for him in the Premier League and he was supposedly the great American hope.<br/><br/>It's the world's game. We need to see it like the world does. Right now, there isn't an American manager who can really do that. ",

If you serve 5 years there's a lifetime pension of over $100K per year. <br/><br/>Read - <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2gBBpCz\" title=\"http://bit.ly/2gBBpCz\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/2gBBpCz</a>",
