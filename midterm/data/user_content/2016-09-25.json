				"commentBody": "On the team: For once with Man U, it was beautiful movement soccer (at least for the half that counted).<br/><br/>I've only been watching them since the last 2 years of Ferguson, but they looked better (much better) in the 1st half, than I've ever seen them (so many of the victories under Ferguson that I saw, came despite their being outplayed almost the entire game, but believing in themselves enough to come out ahead - along of course with some remarkable passes and game management by the often by then sub Giggs).<br/><br/>On Rooney: I obviously missed his great years.  For someone who can't dribble, can't create his own shot, used to have (that I saw) composure to score when receiving the ball in scoring position, and able to make some brilliant pass\u00e9s, he's scored a lot of goals!  To me, even when he was scoring goals, an extremely one dimensional player.  Now he's kind of like the Charles Barkley of the EPL - completely distorting the flow of the game for his own ponderous plans, which often go nowhere.  No fun to watch.  A dark cloud on the flow of the game.  Better moved to other pastures if he wants to keep playing.",

Jose would be crazy to start Rooney up front with those guys available. That said, Rooney will surely get his time in, but mostly as a midfielder. Never say never, just think of how negative Jose has been in the past about Mata and look at how he's been proven wrong.",

				"commentBody": "One of the first sects that I encountered as a young spiritual seeker was Sufism - and although I was never tempted to join, I was nonetheless favorably impressed.<br/><br/>If all Islam were like Sufism, there would be no hostility towards Islam in the west.  Unfortunately, Sufism is not especially representative of Islam.  <br/><br/>As regards the comments of Mr. Morrow later in this piece, I could not disagree more.  You can profitably pick and choose parts of any religion on earth - and I encourage everyone to do so.<br/><br/>If God exists, and has inspired spiritual traditions across the planet, each intended for use in a specific time and place, and best understood by careful exploration of the culture of that time and place - as He surely has if He can be said to authentically exist - then sectarian doctrine is ultimately little more than the husk of an ancient harvest, no longer wholly fit for consumption by modern men.<br/><br/>I would submit that the task for modern men and women of faith and spirit must be to go beyond the ancient forms, to remove the ancient blinders, and instead identify those living principles that animate every tradition and emphasize our essential, shared humanity - old and new, eastern and western.  For if God authentically exists, then He, She, or It has inspired all of them.  And rumor has it that He, She, or It continues to inspire authentic seekers, even to this day.<br/><br/>Namaste.",

It admonishes on multiple occasions to not divide the the religion into sects. Therefore, there aren't as many Moslems on earth as the census bureau would have us believe. Anyone who puts a / past Moslem be it Sunni, Shiite, Sufi etc with further slash marks for Sunni/Wahhabi, Sunni/Salefi, bla bla is in violation of the Qur'an, which indeed puts a bigger emphasis on anti-sectarianism  than pork, alcohol, adultery combined! There are practical considerations and eventual forgiveness mentioned for all three, but none for dividing religion into sects \"after knowledge has reached them\", be it Moslem, Jew,  or Christian. That's why the Sunni/Shiite rivalry has fomented so much nonsense and evil while driven by clergy on the payroll.",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>.<br/>CROSSWORDESE<br/><br/>Martin, I read a lot about \"crosswordese\". In this grid, OSE might be condemned as \"crosswordese\" by Rex or Amy. Constructor Jeff may have called OSE a \"gluey bit\".<br/><br/>You are by now familiar with my belief that many such entries are useful to someone. Chemists may be more likely to speak of sucrOSE or glucOSE, but it's useful to know OSE as a denotation of a sugar. ASE denotes an enzyme, or a guy who dies in some Danish work.<br/><br/>\"Useful\" is my focus here.<br/><br/>At the Downriver Golf Club, the clubhouse is used one night a week for a Trivia competition, open to nonmembers. First prize is SCRIP worth $20 against a bar/restaurant bill there. Second and third prizes are lesser SCRIP.<br/><br/>One night, a question was put to the competitors: Name the tree that fits a certain description. In the 3-part description, one element was the traditional use of the tree's wood to make longbows. Therefore, I wrote YEW on the answer sheet without consulting my teammates. Why? Because YEW appears in crosswords as an archer's wood. Is YEW CROSSWORDESE? Not to me. Our bill was over $100 with tip. Another team member had also offered to pay, in honor of our teammate who was moving back to SF the next morning, so our pre-arrangement was that I would pay $90 and my teammate could pay the rest.<br/><br/>We won by one point. That point was for YEW. I saved 22% off my $90 contribution after the team voted that I should reap the benefit of the SCRIP. If a grid word saves me $20, it's a real word.",

				"commentBody": "Two suggestions for HRC: One of the few things that appall both progressives and conservatives is an ungrateful child. For the past year (perhaps more) The Donald has continually played up the notion that he's a self-made success, a man who has single-handedly built his company into a billion-dollar enterprise. Even were we to overlook the contributions of his staff and other corporate officers, the fact of the matter is that it was Mr. Trump's father who built that company from the ground up and who passed it along as an inheritance to his Donald and his siblings. Has anyone ever heard him even mention his old man?  How many of us, whatever our political convictions, would take credit for the accomplishments of our parents?<br/>Suggestion# 2: Lie.  Kind of.  If things get really tight Monday, why not do what The Donald himself does virtually every time he opens his mouth? If it's okay for Mr. Trump to have libeled the incumbent President of the United States with the falsehood that he was born abroad even after he presented his U.S. birth certificate, why not simply announce that your opponent has paid absolutely no taxes for a period of, say, ten years?  More than likely, this allegation would prove accurate. In any case, the only way it could be shown to be false is via the submission of Mr. Trump's tax returns. Let's get real: there's only one reason why The Donald hasn't released them by now. Either he accepts Hillary's allegation or he submits the t/r's.                  ",

For some reason, my fastest Sundays have been Patrick Berry puzzles, Jeff Chen puzzles, or puzzles with 2 constructors. So I think my previous Sunday was a puzzle by Judge Vic and someone else. Pair Jeff Chen with another constructor, and it's a recipe for speed for me.<br/><br/>That's not to say there were no stumbling blocks. MISSENd or MISSENT??? INTIME or oNTIME?? I usually made the wrong choice. I did not have any reason to think I was going fast.<br/><br/>But solve times this week were awry in my experience. Fastest was Monday, then Tuesday, as expected. Wednesday was hard for a Wednesday (slower than my average, whereas Mon and Tue were right around my averages for those days, so the gap between Tuesday's solve time and Wednesday's was larger than I expect). After Wednesday things got weird. I solved Friday's less than a minute slower than Wednesday's. But Thursday was slower than Friday (by the same margin as I had between Tuesday and Wednesday).<br/><br/>I usually expect Thursdays to require a range of time for the solve; this past Thursday solve time was slower than midrange. Friday's solve time would have been near the low end of Thursday range. Then Sunday solved less than a minute slower than Thursday; Saturday took me half a minute more than Sunday. So my order from fastest to slowest was M, T, W (by more than usual), F, Th, Sun, Sat. Not a typical crossword week for me.",

It is strange that some Americans think by electing a privileged,narcissistic,non-Christian,that will make us great. By any political parties standards, a Trump Presidency is un-American. A twisted,un-ethical candidate of selfishness. Is he the culmination of the \"Me Generation\"? of the 1980's? ",
