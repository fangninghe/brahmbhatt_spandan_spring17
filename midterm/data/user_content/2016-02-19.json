				"commentBody": "No, actually, those four economists who used to be on the CEA handwavingly CLAIM that Friedman's claims about Sanders's program are not credible.  Sanders makes no claims, other than noting that Friedman has done an analysis which they like.<br/><br/>The four economists provide no evidence because *they have done no analysis*.  If they actually sat down and did analysis and published it, they would be credible.  BUT THEY DIDN'T.  Their letter consists of bare, handwaving, evidence-free assertion.<br/><br/>At least -- unlike the letter writers -- Krugman is trying to make some sort of argument in his post here.  But he first claims that unemployment can't go below 4% (which, I am told, it did as recently as 1999) and then claims that the decline in labor force participation is due largely to retirement (which evidence shows is entirely false; participation is still down among the 18-55 years old age brackets).  So it isn't a good argument.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Friedman gave a range of 2.1% - 5.3% growth.  This is a perfectly reasonable range, and mocking the high-end number only is... deliberately misleading.<br/><br/>I don't know why Romer, Tyson, and Krueger signed on to this content-free letter.  Goolsbee is corrupt; he's joined a hedge fund.",

Far better to let them participate and continually exert pressure to ever better compliance.  Part of the pressure is to report how they digress, remind everyone why and this may help to give the average Iranian hope of a better future and help others see the light.

It shows level of desperation and frustration built up by the democratic system. the people elect a president based on his commitments in talk shows and debates. Once he is elected, he is not allowed to implement his policies as he is controlled by \"non-presidents\". Just look at Obama who is in power yet so powerless. He is just passing his precious time in office twiddling his thumbs. meanwhile america wanders rudderless. it's not funny. it is painful to see once mighty america plunging to its death.
