				"commentBody": "Exactly what value system can somebody be said to have when they insist that they want to build something for their own interests, but will make you pay for it? On this same line of thought, why don't I just go over to my neighbor and tell them that they are paying for the in-ground pool that I want on my property? Because, as most of us learn at a very young age, if we want something, WE have to work for it. That means, if we want an 'A', if we want to run fast, if we want to get a raise, if we want to buy a new car, if we want to get a date, then WE are the ones who will have to work for it. The very notion that something that we want should be provided for us by others is a fundamental display of lassitude and an abdication of responsibility. I'm surprised that so many religious people support Trump, when he so consistently violates any semblance of morality -- lust, greed, wrath, pride, and now sloth in wishing to have others pick up the bill (i.e. do all the work) for something he wants to build. Truly, the longer this election goes on, the more I feel it is being proved to me that this society is not something I relate to in the least. I yearn for the times where, even if morals were not upheld by all people, at the very least, they were held high as ideals and aspired to. To see people so abandon any sense of goodness is a strike at the core of the human spirit which leaves me too disheartened to explain.",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>I truly miss JFC tonight. His avatar would have been ICONic, and he may have been helpful on this issue.<br/><br/>As the MTF of the group (which apparently for this puzzle would mean something not altogether congruent with what it means to me), I will say to use M in all those squares. Or F. I used M because I choose to identify as such for GENDER purposes. You may use F. The answers you tried are more FLUID.<br/><br/>As a longtime successful solver (regardless of what the software thinks), I'll say that no streak matters, except insofar as it is a burden because people get a bit caught up in issues such as how to enter the rebii successfully. Hence, I sometimes stop my own streak by hitting Check on a letter I know to be right. My supposed streak is now somewhere in the TEENs. So what. Another Commenter claims to have one of more than 300 days. So what.<br/><br/>But I recommend using a single letter this time. Never forget that if your browser happens to crash before the website registers that you completed the puzzle on time and successfully, you will see a blue star instead of a gold one, and your streak will end. You must then contact the excellent Customer Care people to remedy this. As you may have guessed, I did not contact them when it happened to me.<br/><br/>Oh, 2 more things.<br/><br/>1. It's not a \"winning\" streak, although Donald Trump may say so. He thinks \"winning\" is what it's all about. It's a solving streak. He's not so good at solutions.<br/><br/>2.
