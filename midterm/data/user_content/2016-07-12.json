				"commentBody": "CD, I have had the same absurd discussions regarding what gulf state women think of as \"rights.\" Essentially, they have no real concept of what rights actually mean. One woman told me that Islam was better for women than the west because in Islam, women had the right to a wedding announcement. As if our society with free speech would not include the right to such an annoucement. But they don't understand what free speech is. They basically conflate cultural practices they are told to be attached to with rights. Girls are raised to revolve around marriage and children, so they get attached to their marital contracts and confuse the financial support granted by these contracts with rights when it's really the opposite- it's a society that defines woman's lives according to the ways men barter their sexuality as property of men. Saudi women don't understand that they don't actually have the right to get married because their male relatives can forbid their marriages for any arbitrary reason. <br/><br/>Saudi women are also taught to distract conversations about womens rights by saying \"what about palestinian women's right to self determination?\" In reality, palestinian women can wear their hair down and drive cars even if Israel is barricading them. They have more self determination by law than Saudi women, but Saudi women don't formally understand what self determination means. ",
