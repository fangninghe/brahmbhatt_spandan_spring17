My wife died March 23, 2015 under similar circumstances although thankfully days not months. My wife made it clear to me during our 30  years relationship that she<br/>Never wanted advanced life support. She had advanced cancer and a complex surgical procedure which failed and as sepsis set in her liver, kidneys and lungs failed. All the doctors said we can save her except the liver specialist. He said if she lives she will need a liver transplant but you must be cancer free for two years before you get on the list. He then described the horror of her future life waiting on a liver. I proceeded with terminating her life support knowing I was respecting her wishes and doing the right thing. As I went through the grief process and missed her so much I became convinced I made a mistake because all the others said they could save her. They never said at what cost, only the liver expert told the truth. Thank you for bringing this work forward, it has reminded me of why I made my decision and why it was the right decision. I will never be at peace with the transition of my wife but I can be at peace with the decisions I made about her end of life care. Thank you so much",

Pennetta was \"light as a feather\"and deadly accurate, Kerber found the craziest angles and her serve became a weapon, and Muguruza was, as Judy Murray quipped, \"muguruthless\" in her aggressive game and massive strokes (not to mention a funky match point lob) in Paris. I wish the fans, including the \"Serena is Queen\" crowd, could just let the action play out match after match and appreciate the results and the wonderful, individual sport tennis is.

I definitely am in awe of what Djokovic can do.  I am amazed by his range and flexibility, his ability to go from defense to offense in a nanosecond.  So if he wins a grand slam, I will accept it, but not celebrate long.  I don't know if what I am saying is just about me, or if the sentiments are more widely shared.  <br/><br/>I like Serena and wish her well, but somehow I am more drawn to Venus and her story of comeback.

Yet some fools like Trump still do not get it that the number of votes is the reason that Obama is our president. <br/><br/>The way of electing presidents is based on the US Constitution while the way of recognizing true number one in tennis is based on rules established by the  Association of Tennis Professionals' (ATP) merit-based method for determining rankings in tennis.

Part of it is that \u2014 due to their distance from them \u2014 they have nothing to say to people who are suffering and angry about it other than to scorn them as hateful losers. Part of it is that journalists \u2014 like anyone else \u2014 tend to react with bitterness and rage, not self-assessment, as they lose influence and stature.\"<br/><br/>\"But a major factor is that many people recognize that establishment journalists are an integral part of the very institutions and corrupted elite circles that are authors of their plight. Rather than being people who mediate or inform these political conflicts, journalists are agents of the forces that are oppressing them.

Why do you buy the hate?<br/><br/>Brexit should have shown us all that burning down the house just leaves people homelsss.  It will be the little people who pay.",
