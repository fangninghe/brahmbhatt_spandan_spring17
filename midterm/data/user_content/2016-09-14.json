President Obama, wisely in my book, refused to commit numbers of ground troops to combat in Syria, after foolishly declaring a red line where a U.S.invasion would have been another disaster. But if he isn't going make \"war, war\" the President had an obligation, in Churchill's phrase to \"jaw. jaw\" with Russia to see if the two countries could agree on a practical way to end the slaughter and, if possible, grease Assad's way to the exit.<br/><br/>Moreover, it's not clear from the article if Carter objects to any negotiations with Russia over Syria  or to specific aspects of the Kerry-Lavrov agreement.  it is the practical differences between the two that should have been the focus of the article, rather than on legacies, which are insubstantial in comparison with the great horror of Syria.",
