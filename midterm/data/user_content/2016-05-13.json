But how can the boys use the girls bathroom where there will be no urinals.You certainly don't expect those growing young men to squat do you? Just like at home they will splatter pee all over the walls and seat (which of course will be down). And they will expect Mommy to clean it up! Ohhh, you don't think so?? Then you have never been in Army boot camp.<br/><br/>I wish they would have let me go in the girls bathroom when I was a kid. Even then we thought up lots of mean tricks to play like pounding on the walls and writing nasty stuff on the door. Oh what fun this is going to be for the new crop of little boys. Glue on the seat? That kind of stuff. Wait, you aren't counting on the boys not trying to claim they are transgender are you? If you are then you have never been in elementary school.",

							"commentBody": "I agree with much of what you say. But democratic processes include more than simply voting every four years. True democratic leadership sets up democratic processes that listen and integrate and revise and correct rather than simply issuing edicts. It works with the society and culture and the sincere concerns of citizens. This is an instance in which we need democratic culture to work. <br/><br/>There are disagreements and misunderstandings that could be worked through with more discussion. For example, I do not agree that the edict in this case is similar to the process of women's winning the right to vote. I also do not believe that the civil rights analogies are correct. The AG makes it sound as if having \"Male\" and \"Female\" rest rooms is equivalent to segregation and Jim Crow. I also do not believe that the issue of locker rooms and the repercussions more broadly have been thought through. I could change my mind on some issues, but the federal government has decided that it is morally and culturally superior to us citizens and doesn't have to respect our benighted concerns. Instead it will use its power and force over us. I agree that this is bold, but I also believe that pushing the issue so far beyond transgender rights and dignity threatens the effort to protect trans people's rights and dignity, as well as the rights and dignity of non-trans citizens. I believe that it is a bad decision. It comes partly from the blindness and felt superiority of having power. ",

I suppose a lot of people still feel \"uncomfortable\" around people with HIV.  If you say transgender kids aren't beaten and scorned, you're a very cruel person.  Personally I wouldn't care if all restrooms were co-ed where adults are concerned.  I think I would know how to act.  If you're afraid of rapists, don't let women leave their homes.  ",

Turned out now even people from places prone to bigotry don't object to gays in the military.  We muddled through and got to a perfect result.  The way Obama is handling this seems intended to polarize and make people dig in their heels which is the exactly what you don't want.
