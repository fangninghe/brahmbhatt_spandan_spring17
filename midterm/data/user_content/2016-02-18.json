				"commentBody": "It is the President's responsibility to nominate a jurist to fulfill the position.  It is also the Senate's responsibility to vet that nomination. This has to happen. If that candidate fails pass whatever criteria the Senate uses, then the President will have the option to cut a deal or nominate someone else. This happened 30 years ago with Robert Bork, who was completely \"qualified\" to be on the bench, and President Reagan was forced to nominate someone deemed to be more moderate by the Democratic-controlled Senate. This led to the unanimous confirmation of Anthony Kennedy (the long-standing swing vote on the bench). <br/><br/>At the time, President Reagan had around 18 months left on his second term, President Obama has 11.<br/><br/>This time around, both sides will likely use this nomination as a political tool in an election year, rather than as an opportunity to find middle ground.",

Some people even walk long distances to go around another way than to go near their home.<br/><br/>Boo does not come out from his house, or when the neighbor's see. He was in trouble with the police when he was a young boy, and is very religious. His parents kept him inside. He lives with his brother, and Miss Stephanie claims that she saw Boo Radley stab his father in the leg while clipping out articles from the newspaper.<br/><br/>Scout and Jem believe that he may be the person leaving many things for them to find in the tree. They find a spelling metal, two Indian-head pennies, bars of soap that resemble Scout and Jem, a watch, gum, and some other things. When Miss Maudie's house catches on fire, Scout is outside in the cold watching. Boo comes up behind her and puts a blanket on her without Scout even noticing until she came home with a blanket around her shoulders.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the book, when Mr. Ewells tries to attack Jem and Scout, Boo comes out and stabbs Mr. Ewells to save Jem. Scout walks Boo home and the sheriff claims that Mr. Ewells fell on his own knife. Boo is never seen again.<br/><br/>Scout, at the end, \"walks through\" Boo's shoes when she walks him home and we realize that Scout and Jem are almost like Boo's children.",

But the problem is gerrymandered districts and voter suppression.  It's the digital age, where a person can make purchases online in an instant, renew licenses online, fill out every kind of form, pay bills, etc., but we have to wait in 4 hours lines to vote on decrepit machines and jump through unending hoops.  Can you imagine Republicans ever winning even a local election for dog catcher if people could vote online, from anywhere, with the ease of buying from Amazon?  They wouldn't.  And that is why they cut up districts and suppress the vote.  On day one, if Hillary or Bernie win, is to make voting as easy as ordering a pizza.   ",

It doesnt because they are forced by the system to spend most of their time groveling for money that they are not allowed to spend on themselves.  This humiliation is a filter for congressmen, since those willing to grovel are unlikely to be hostile to free enterprise and its ways, and often not even to its excesses.  ",

Or compare the 1.6 million missing jobs you are whining about with the jobs added recently: since the beginning of 2014 we have added 5.7 million full-time private sector jobs, and are on-trend to add another 5 million over 2016-2017.<br/><br/>See how you have been brainwashed with propagandists using the esoteric LFPR to mislead you into believing in fake unemployment rates of 30+%?

Trump has been able to vault to the top of the Republican pack by speaking in vague generalities and making ridiculous economic revival claims and he has benefited greatly in the polls.  Democrats tightly mock Trump and his unrealistic followers that appear to believe his mumbo jumbo.  What amuses is that Sanders is tapping into the left wing of the Democratic Party who also display the same traits and characteristics of their right wing counterparts. ",

Of course, this even assumes Bernie can even get himself elected and pass all of these programs in the first place.

Plus, there are reasons US healthcare costs more other than efficiency. You don't want to damage the rate of technological innovation under the restrictions of a sudden and untested bureaucracy. The sheer political and ecomonimic weight of what Bernie is promising to do instantly is just too much to bear, and his numbers do not add up. Healthcare, free college and not just fixing but increasing social security all at once? That much simultaneous taxing and wealth redistribution is going to pass, really? It all going to work perfectly and not cause a massive and risky economic shock and public backlash? Progressive evolution rather that revolution has a far, far better chance of working and being accepted by a skeptical public. I'm afraid that when the true costs of Bernie's plans get a wider hearing, it will also all scare middle America even more. That my progressive friends, is a losing strategy.",
