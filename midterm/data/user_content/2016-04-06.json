Attacking the WSJ for not attacking Ryan for not attacking Trump by name. You\u2019re so good with your stiletto, we don\u2019t even see the blade.  Ryan could say more, more forcefully.  But I agree with his crystal blue persuasion.  History shows again and again how nature points up the folly of man.  Trump support derives from sympathy.  Jimmy Boy Edming has it right:  \u201cThe more and more that they attack Trump, the more people are going to vote for him.\u201d<br/><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/30/meet-wisconsins-first-pro-trump-state-legislator/\" title=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/30/meet-wisconsins-first-pro-trump-state-legislator/\" target=\"_blank\">http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/03/30/meet-wisconsins-first-pro-trump...</a>",

				"commentBody": "The modern GOP invented itself when Reagan launched himself in Phil Ms dog whistling states rights at the location of the freedom rider murders.  H W Bush sold his soul to the devil with Willie Horton.  W went to Bob Jones University which prohibited interracial dating to launch his campaign.  Both Ryan &amp; Romney peddled the maker taker ideas.  Now Trump is the same guy without the dog whistle.<br/><br/>These guys howl about the low growth environment Obama created.  Obama's skills are so great he's created that same environment around the world.  Our low growth experience leads the world.<br/><br/>Facts don't matter.  The fast talking idiot in Louisiana has ruined that state.  Kansas is racing to the bottom.  North Carolina is on its way.  What they have in common is devotion to the supply side voo doo.<br/><br/>The outrage these folks feel is real.  Corporations and the financial industry have enriched themselves while shafting the middle class.  Now the bills have come due in terms of low growth b/c no one has any money to spend except the top 10%.  <br/><br/>Here in NC dem votes don't really matter.  They outvoted pubs in 2012 by about 80,000 votes and yet the US House votes ended up with 9 pubs and 4 dems.  In 2014 they outvoted dems 55% to 45% and the result was 10 pubs to 3 dems.  So the con movement is not above real voter fraud.<br/><br/>Facts don't matter in con world.  Faith is all that matters.  Faith in nonsense that results in the rise of the 1%.",

Its only half-time; its close; Hillary's biggest wins are behind her and Bernie has momentum.<br/>2) The writing is on the wall that the Repubs will find a way to nominate somebody other than Trump, so the Dems should not want to be the single party that nominates a candidate with such high UNfavorable ratings; Bernie does much better in most of the head to head polls against the various republicans and Hillary can only beat Trump.

When people see that happening in the general election campaign, you will see her numbers MOVE. The Republicans know that, and that's why they would much rather run against Bernie. Their smearmeisters are itching to go to work on him, but they have the sophistication and the discipline to keep their powder dry for now. They already have lots of ammunition stockpiled. He started political life as a Trotskyite. He made a documentary in the 70's urging world wide revolution. He hung a hammer and sickle flag in his Burlington office. He went to the USSR for his honeymoon. That's just for starters. By the time they're finished with him, I guarantee you he won't look the same in those head to head polls as he looks today. ",

Speaking of tokens, after 25 years working in a city with one of the most heavy concentrations of African American citizens in the country, he did not have one black person on his staff - not one at any level - until well into the presidential campaign when he was evidently informed that a large portion of the Democratic electorate is . . .wait for it . . .black! He runs a large government-funded office and there were no black people there.  It looked just like his actual home state - lily-white Vermont - and the people who vote for him.",
