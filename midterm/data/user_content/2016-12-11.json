				"commentBody": "How can ANY liberal be unable to imagine that people think differently from them, when its become impossible for their party to have even a prayer of controlling Congress? The shock was not that Hillary could lose, but that an narcissitic, unreflective, and completely inexperienced bully could beat her.<br/>While I think its reprehensible if someone in your position can be fired for conservative views, you have to be old enough to know that we've tried these \"moderate tax and regulation policies\" repeatedly since the 1980s, and whatever growth they cause has not redounded to working people. What would give you the slightest reason to believe an even more radical version of the same thing (more radical given no possible effective opposition from Democrats) will be any different this time?",

				"commentBody": "When Immanuel Kant wrote his essay on the question \"What is Enlightenment?\" he posited that enlightenment would happen if there were a totally free exchange of ideas for everyone 'as a scholar', independent from what the person's duties were in the outside world. We have not yet reached a state where such free exchange of ideas is possible. Generally speaking, the conservatives all too often don't want to follow the rules of 'scholarly discourse' because they are too sure of what they believe. On the other hand, if you were to utter overly liberal ideas in a business environment (even if it were entirely outside of the workplace), your chances of surviving in that world would be minimal. There are very uneven power distributions between adherents of liberal and less liberal views, and we have not even advanced to a point of liberty which was envisioned in the 18th century.<br/><br/> To obtain a stronger voice for conservatives in academic, all we'd need is more thoughtful conservatives. They would be quite welcome in the academy, and most university presidents would love them since they could extol them when they beg from wealthy alumni. So, Mr. Kristof, if you want more diversity in academia, why don't you exhort conservatives to study harder and then pursue an academic career that pays way less than the business world. We'd have a more balanced intellectual life in a jiffy.",

I notice that the comments focus on the more outrageous positions taken by conservatives and religionists, but we push some pretty controversial ideas too. While it is satisfying to preach to the choir, and being in the choir is pretty satisfying, we end up being stunned when the world doesn't fit our measurements. I don't think our children's minds will be poisoned by hearing honest presentation of right wing ideas, or at least honest debate. Listening is the key to critical thinking. I, for one don't want our universities to produce cookie-cutter thinking. Listen more. Compare and contrast. There is a larger world outside academia.",

There was no balanced rendering of events by Obama and Clinton in 2012 until AFTER the election, yet they were told the truth explicitly by people on the ground in Benghazi from almost the beginning.<br/><br/>When it happened, I condemned Romney in this forum for his public outrage that the truth wasn't being told by the administration; and when it became evident that we'd all been played for political reasons, I laughed and shrugged as well in this forum -- it was too late to affect the election.<br/><br/>Trump won in the Electoral College because of Mrs. Clinton's mistake of not campaigning in the upper Midwest and PA, believing that she had most of those battleground states sewn up. By such errors of political judgment does a candidate amass a popular vote plurality of 2.6 millions and STILL watches cabinet picks being made on Fifth Ave. and not in Chappaqua.<br/><br/>Gotta say, though: for eight years I've had my issues with Barack Obama's policies (not the man); but I never once questioned his legitimacy, which is all Democrats seem able to do with Trump.",

Remember, he is not just a con-man, he is a big-money professional con-man (professional:  it's how he makes his living; documentation is found in the N. Y. Times and the Washington Post).  That means if you believe anything he says, you're being conned. <br/><br/>Is this paranoid?  No, the evidence is right out in public.  LIsten to Trump's speeches, and if you reject his public speaking, read about what he says in his business as reported by his associates.

				"commentBody": "This is a great essay. However. I have to disagree with the statement that \"the mainstream news media can\u2019t do a thing\" to deal with the fact that millions of Americans are so willing to accept baseless conspiracy theories as political facts.  Certainly, neither the media nor almost anyone else, can reason with these people. But what the media can do is to help demonstrate that the Republican politicians and conservative movements who traffic in these conspiracy theories or fail to firmly reject them are unacceptable in our political system.<br/><br/>Trump, of course, is the most obvious example of the media's failure on this front. By any reasonable standard, Trump's trafficking in false conspiracy theories, along with his bigotry and complete lack of policy knowledge, made him completely unqualified to be President. Yet the media treated him as a legitimate candidate and ridiculously portrayed Clinton as somehow less honest than Trump. This was an epic failure, but far from the only. The reality is that most of today's Republican Party peddles in falsehoods and conspiracy theories in order to rile up the type of people who get their \"news\" from Breitbart, Fox, and other organs of misinformation. It is incumbent on our media to call out such outrageous behavior out for what it should be considered - disqualifying for elected positions in a democracy that we have little time left to save from utter destruction by conservatives.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive/\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive/</a> ",

It first needs to dis-aggregate the term \"media\" so as to correctly lay entertainment on one side and reporting, analysis, and considered opinon on the other side. It needs to explain that professional journalists are specialists and that their organizations invest heavily in each story. It needs to contrast this with the world of non-specialist opinionators -- of which I, for example, am playing a small role here -- and the various venues in which they present themselves.  The other side of the media -- entertainment -- needs to clean up its act and stop presenting a fictitious world of conspiracies, slaughterers, rapists and war mongers; no less than the whole cast of repugnant stereotypes depicting class, race, religion -- you name it.  With consolidations in \"media\" e.g. Fox, NBC/Comcast etc. I'd have a hard time believing that the profit difference would be so great as not to pursue this.",

				"commentBody": "At a campus where both politically conservative and liberal views are expressed, as well as views on religion openly expressed and embraced, I think that grouping conservatives and evangelicals together is one problem here. Evangelical does not necessarily mean conservative. And religious does not necessarily mean evangelical. While there is a core of truth to the argument here, I do think that part of the problem is that the left has ceded religion to the right. Both in academia and elsewhere, listening to people of faith and helping our students realize that \"faith\" does not necessarily mean an embrace of racism and misogyny could go a long way toward helping the conversation.  While I agree that an overwhelmingly \"left\" academia has serious shortcomings, might it be part of the problem that the right in the United States of America has come to stand for things that are ideologically inconsistent and problematic? e.g. condemning abortion while embracing gun rights, or cuts to aid for poor children and families.  When academics are trained to make ideologically consistent arguments, it's hard to embrace rejecting refugees, cutting health care, and Christianity in the same breath.  As an academic and Christian, I find the positions to be untenable,and while I might very well support or at least be sympathetic to, an ideologically consistent conservatism - I am horrified at the anti-immigrant, pro-gun, Islamophobic rhetoric that has taken over our Republican party.

It's about the winners and losers in the comparative advantages of international trade, and policy considerations needed for dealing with the larger economic adjustments. <br/><br/>And, no, I don't mean \"losers\" in the pejorative sense nor \"winners\" in the morally superior sense. The losers are people who lose their jobs to overseas competition and/or factory automation, and winners are people who buy the marginally less expensive and/or higher quality goods. I'm sure there's a graph with lines that cross and arrows that show direction to prove this point. Something to do with marginal something or other.<br/><br/>The fact that this divide between winners and losers exists in one way or another in countries across the globe speaks to the larger issue; it's not just the white working class in the American Great Lakes region. Policy makers--the elite?--haven't \"made\" policies that effectively address the dislocations that are the flip side of all the good stuff that comes from trade. Not in Europe, not in Japan, not in China, not in the United States.<br/><br/>I'm sure right-winger nationalists in France who used to have better jobs like eating food that the liberal French elite look down on.

				"commentBody": "I'm a retired psychology professor and would like to defend my profession against charges of liberal bias. To begin, people should stop using liberal or conservative since there are no consistent definitions of either term. We can talk about people who vote for Democrats or Republicans; that is an objective categorization, and fairly stable. Most college professors vote for Democrats, but is that evidence of bias? Only two kinds of people vote for Republicans: rich people and dumb people. I do not believe that is a matter of opinion, but an objective fact--I also believe there are real facts in the world. Unless they have family money, college professors are almost never rich. Since a Ph.D. is a job requirement, they are rarely stupid--maybe no common sense, but not stupid since you can't get into a Ph.D. program without high GRE scores, and the GRE is a good intelligence test. Professors are trained to evaluate their ideas with evidence. To be a Republican, you have to believe things like tax cuts for rich people stimulate the economy or that your Party cares about blue collar workers that have no supporting evidence. It is thus not surprising that few professors vote for Republicans and wonder about people who do. That's not bias; that's dealing with the real world in objective terms. It's what we try to teach our students, and thankfully college degrees were the strongest predictor of political behavior in the recent election.    ",

This is the problem with starting out with a view that conservatives or Republicans are under-represented because their current views aren't on campus. Their views might not be on campus because every time those views get fully researched they turn out to just not be defensible (looking at you climate change skeptics).",
