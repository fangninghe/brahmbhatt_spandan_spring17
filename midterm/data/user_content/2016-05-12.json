				"commentBody": "\"In 2015, Bronx courts processed 45,000 misdemeanor arraignments but only 98 misdemeanor trials\"<br/><br/>What that really means is that they don't do trials. It is 0.2% of cases going to trial. The other 99.8% don't get a trial.<br/><br/>They avoid it by making the situation so impossible that cases go away.<br/><br/>To avoid spending one day each month for over two years sitting at court, almost all defendants will plead to something less costly. A small fine for a lesser charge counts as \"a conviction\" for prosecutor and police. It gets the defendant out of the problem.<br/><br/>The prosecutor has the other side of the problem. He MUST offer a deal for something better than that. How much better likely depends on things like the crime charged, the evidence, the witnesses available, and the ability of the attorney on the other side. The dealing becomes not guilt or innocence, but some rule of thumb.<br/><br/>Not mentioned in the article is the witnesses. They must be available each month too. If a cop leaves the force, his pending cases likely fail. If they lose track of witnesses over the years, the case will fail. A private attorney will put serious energy into knowing more about the witnesses than the prosecutor, so he knows when they no longer can produce the witnesses to make their case -- married, got a new job, moved, even just died. It is a lot of people to keep track of, for 45,000 cases/year it must amount to near half a million witnesses. They can't do it.<br/><br/>It becomes a game.",

It will be interesting to compare the 2015 number WHEN IT IS RELEASED to automobile deaths in 2015.<br/><br/>The number of passenger vehicle occupants killed in crashes declined by 3 percent in 2013 to 21,132.  This was the lowest since 1975 according to the DOT.  Yes; you had a greater chance of being killed in an auto accident than in a gang related shooting.<br/><br/>At this point we should be more concerned about fast-tracking the adoption of autonomous automobile rules across the country.  The adoption of autonomous vehicles by the public has many advantages - including virtually eliminating the source of way more deaths each year.<br/><br/>Another benefit would be relegating traffic court to the history books and a reduction of highway patrol positions that no longer are needed or fund-able through tickets.  Elimination of the need to worry about drunk driving.  <br/><br/>Perhaps the FBI could focus on ways to ensure that this country grows economicly.  We need people working - not behind bars in a prison.  How can we eliminate gangs and organized crime - and replace them with jobs and family.  These are the questions the FBI should be contemplating today.",

Social media has been an instrument of fermenting extremes and influencing passive thinkers for some time. Together these factors mean that our police have been dealing with a somewhat more charged environment overall. Many conversations are necessary to sort through this dynamic social time. We need to all slow down to listen, and support sincere leaders taking steps toward rebalancing our communities as we test - and are tested by -change. Our police and law enforcers are trained to handle the instabilities of individuals and groups to maintain community safety with the law as guide. Let's remember they are there to protect us and give each man and woman in uniform the acceptance and respect we ask for ourselves.",

Doctors have morbidity and mortality reviews. Pilots rigorously study accidents to learn about pilot error and mechanical failures. Teachers and professors are evaluated by their students, parents, and peers and administrators in order to improve their teaching performance. Yet, when police officers intentionally or accidentally kill unarmed people or arrest people without cause, we hear that any type of evaluation by the public such as video is harmful to policing and may be increasing the crime rate. Those are scare tactics that reveal how out of touch and unprofessional the police force and culture are. A truly professional and well-educated police force would root out the overly aggressive, racist officers just as medicine and pilots would remove physicians or pilots who were terrible at their jobs. A professional and well-educated police force would implement a rigorous institutionalized process where all officers study and learn from other officers' mistakes -- the mistakes in which officers are killed or injured as well as the mistakes where officers kill or injure others. Instead, we have a culture in which police deny that mistake occur, refuse to study or examine them and blame the mistakes on the people that they killed. We need far-reaching changes in hiring and training officers.",

The airline industry learned that without carefully examining mistakes or near misses in which accidents were narrowly averted, they could not learn what they needed to learn in order to prevent accidents.  Pilots were not willing to report near misses for fear of being disciplined or even losing their jobs.  Once the airlines took a non punitive approach, pilots began reporting near misses and safety improved.  Medicine adopted what is called \"just culture\" recognizing that most mistakes were not due to incompetence or individual malfeasance, but instead resulted from faulty processes.  But, quality review in medicine is not done in public and in fact findings are protected from discovery by plaintiff's attorneys in many states.  Contrast that with what happens in police cases, where for the most part officers are tried in the streets or in the press before investigation even starts. The challenge is to distinguish legitimate mistakes from reckless behavior and outright criminality be it by pilots, medical professionals or police.  That requires a thorough, timely and unbiased review, away from the public eye until complete, done in an atmosphere protected from politics and the emotions of victims. ",
