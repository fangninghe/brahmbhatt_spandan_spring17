Stripped of its ephemera, human history up until the industrial era was a story of psychopaths competing (sometimes collaborating) to attain power, then using that power to dominate and brutalise their fellow human beings.  Such Rulers felt no remorse in wasting the lives of \"their\" Subjects.<br/><br/>If that behaviour seemed to moderate in the Modern Era it was not because human psychology had evolved.  It was just that the nature of the industrial economy - the need to train large numbers of Subjects to operate the complex but not fully automated machinery - made it expedient, for a time, for the Elite to offer certain concessions to those Subjects.<br/><br/>But those conditions were anomalous . . . and temporary.  With the onset of AI and robotics such concessions are no longer needed.<br/><br/>What we have witnessed in the past 30 years is the steady restoration of the historic norm, the \"refeudalisation\" of society.  <br/><br/>And the system of \"elective\" government (it was never Democracy) is an utterly inadequate defence against it.",
