				"commentBody": "Christie:  What pay for play scheme has benefited Russia?  Hillary is anti-coal and for highly regulated fracking because they both are killing the planet.  If you think that the Russians didn't hack the DNC, you are ignoring all the evidence.  And it must be a coincidence that Clinton's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, has made millions representing Putin puppets.  We need to see Don the Con's tax returns to see what his ties to Russia really are.  We know that he was cozy with the mob in his NY business.  Does he also owe the Russian mafia money?  And talk about deflection.  If you look at all of Don the Con's attacks on Hillary, the one thing they have in common are that he accuses her of that which he does and has done.",
