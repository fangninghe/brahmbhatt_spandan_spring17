I believe that she was not the only woman who sought to be his bride. This is what comes to mind when I think of all of those who are in Donald Trump's thrall. Regardless of the revelations, his devotees remain true to this boorish liar who promises to cut a swath of destruction in our body politic analogous to that cut in the lives of those unfortunate young victims of Ted Bundy.",

It was thought at the time that all the chemicals needed to maintain the huge swaths of perfect lawns was the cause. I don't know what the science was worth because brain cancer in children is very uncommon.<br/><br/>Still it might be interesting to find out if groups exposed to turf chemicals might have higher ALS or cancer rates. Are golfers at higher risk?",

				"commentBody": "These proposals are misogyny cloaked in liberalism. There is no truth to the oft-repeated assertion that transwomen have \u201cfemale brains.\u201d Reputable neurologists have repeatedly shown that there is nothing \u201cfemale\u201d about the brain of a transwoman.  Yes, the brain is very plastic, and, with enough female hormones and obsession over appearance, certain parts of the brain may modify in response, but these are changes that result from hormones and brain activity, not inherent differences.<br/>I know teenage girls who won\u2019t dress out for gym because male students have been given access to their locker room. They refuse to undress next to a person they have known as a creepy male for years. Sex-segregated sports are segregated for objective physical reasons. Female bodies develop very different from male bodies, so all-female sports give females a chance to participate in athletics safely and on a level playing field. Introducing males to female teams means that many females will not have opportunities to participate.<br/>I do not blame the youngsters for this mess. I blame the adults who tell children that stereotypes are hard-wired and that a boy who likes clothes and dolls is \u201creally a female\u201d and a girl who is indifferent to clothes and dolls is \u201creally a male.\u201d That is nonsense and we know it. Like other mammals and many other living species, we are sexually dimorphic. We should celebrate children who reject stereotypes, not teach them nonsense about being born in the wrong body.",

Education, integrity, and critical thinking, are being undermined by the few that want their way or the highway.

Moreover, perhaps this demand to have access based on self-gender identity is another way to undermine the many rights women fought for by dismantling that last safe space available to them: the public bathroom.",

				"commentBody": "Has the administration considered at all that this will also end up requiring male students who identify as female to room with female students? Disney movies aside, that doesn't work out well especially on high school trips. I'm curious how the administration continues to ignore medical authorities such as Johns Hopkins and the College of Pediatricians who both say nothing is changed by these measures and great harm can be inflicted. Indeed Johns Hopkins no longer does gender reassignment surgery because no real improvement in psychological state was noted. The College of Pediatricians have called the imposition of the idea of transgenderism on young children child abuse. Most children go through a neutral period until puberty. Yet we have the same folks who are helicopter parents jumping in to claim their son is a girl just because he likes to wear his big sister's tap shoes. As a teacher I won't be able to take highs school students on overnight competitions out of town for fear that I would have to put a male self identifying as female (without even a medical certificate as to status)in a room with actual females. Does our Federal government stop to think of the consequences down the line? ",

				"commentBody": "@Richard: I'm afraid you're now losing your personal credibility even more quickly than are those \"Never Trump!\" politicos who've already embraced him. First off, the Clinton Foundation has actually done a lot of good work in the developing world, regardless of whatever ulterior motives its founders may have been harboring. Second, if it were the Clintons who were declining to release their tax returns you KNOW you'd be joining The Donald and every other member of your Party in their inevitable (and completely justified) denunciations. And then, of course, there's the little matter of that Kenyan birth certificate that Mr. Trump claims to have access to but has never bothered to produce (libel laws, anyone?).  Speaking of libel, I'd be very careful about unproven accusations of rape launched against...anyone.<br/>   But, most importantly, whatever gives you the impression that the most divisive figure in American public life can get DC's liberals and conservatives to come together to do what's right for the great unwashed that he loathes and ridicules?  A man who reverses his policy proposals before he can even complete a sentence can hardly be relied upon to convince other people to drop their ideological horsebleep and do something commonsensical.  Never mind Hillary or Bernie; I'd sooner pledge my soul to Lucifer. At least his agenda has been carefully thought out.              ",

It will result in violence-- let people go into the bathroom were they will be fitting in and let them empty their bladder-- everybody knows how uncomfertable it is not to find a bathroom when needed-- best solution have a single bathroom for everybody like you have in any home and save on plumbing- done in many establishments. The right wing is inventing a problem were there is none and they want to keep this going to distract from the real election for a real US President who is as skilled and compassionate and diplomatic as the current one.
