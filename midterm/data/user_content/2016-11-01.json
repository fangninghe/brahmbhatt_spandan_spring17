				"commentBody": "What compromised the election was telling the FBI that is all there was, and getting a commitment from the FBI closing the case on that assurance, and then getting caught with vast numbers of new emails.<br/><br/>The FBI can see from the metadata that is is to/from Hillary, that it is in the relevant dates, and what the sender said it was re:. That is enough to know they've got more, a lot more.<br/><br/>It is not enough to know what is in that more, but the basic problem is they were told there was no more, and there is. They closed the case based on that assurance, and now find it is not true.<br/><br/>The FBI runs child porn searches constantly, looking for interstate child porn. When they find it, they get a warrant and seize the computer, then look for the porn, and other victims, and the contacts with other pedophiles committing the crime of creating and circulating the stuff. That is what they did here.<br/><br/>Imagine their shock when they turned up plenty of child porn, but also hundreds of thousands of previously unknown to/from the Sec of State during her term of office, re: official matters, per their hundreds of thousands of lines of metadata. That must have gone up the chain of command so fast nobody was sitting down again before it got to the top.<br/><br/>It looks like Huma had set up an automatic forward function to her home computer for her inbox. Then she forgot about it. It has all been sitting there, complete for years, for whoever picks up this pedophiles computer, any body at all.",

				"commentBody": "Dr. K,<br/><br/>I read this blog Binyamin Appelbaum's piece before I read your blog.<br/><br/>My view is that global trade is beneficial but it is the content of the trade that makes a difference.  I think it is foolish to invest in foreign labor just t0 chase cheap labor.   <br/><br/>In my study of history trading nations who seek buyers for their excess goods with the rest of the World in exchange for their goods seems to have benefited.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if we forego markets in other countries who have potential demand for our products it seems to me that we lose something.  <br/><br/>Of particular interest is establishing trade agreements that allows us to export many of our quality of life infrastructure systems know-how such as indoor plumbing, water and waste water treatment, non-fossil electric power, HVAC , etc; <br/><br/>China has been a great market for the advanced countries.  It has done wonders with the quality of living for rural China.  I can remember when we first did trade exchanges with China and saw transformative miracles in agriculture and communications.  When I first observed China, there were very few telephones and now there are millions of cell phones.  The prosperity is obvious.  The same goes for India and most of Africa.  The higher their quality of living the greater the demand for US exports and hopefully through political corrections to our system,  the greater the shared prosperity in the US.  It is just over the last 40 years that we have allowed income inequality to flourish.",

							"commentBody": "Correction to first sentence.<br/><br/>I read Binyamin Appelbaum's piece before I read your blog.  Hold on to your thoughts about big technological advances in transportation.  It is my goal to replace the big rig highway freight trucks with vans that can negotiate city streets and make 90 degree turns from one lane rather than two by carry the delivery vans in, all-electric,  all-weather, 300 mph superconducting Maglev truck-carrying-vehicles. <a href=\"http://www.magneticglide.com\" title=\"www.magneticglide.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.magneticglide.com</a> for concept.  <br/><br/>One of these days industry will stop resisting the idea of an Interstate Maglev Network.  Heavy steel wheels pounding steel rails is obsolete Think about the dramatic improvement in efficiency and safety from a Maglev network that will pay for itself and make a handsome profit for truckers and investors.  All that our government needs to do is just test and certify this system as a pubic carrier.<br/><br/>A good exercise for future blogs is a discussion of the role of invention and technology advances that created the prosperity that we current enjoy.  I know you know that the challenge of global warming means that we must shift away from fossil fuel powered economic sectors.  The evolution could be an opportunity or it could be the most disruptive political fight since slavery and the Civil War. ",

				"commentBody": "It's important for people to understand what went wrong with the government's case. I take the liberty of reposting a comment (by someone else) on an article in the Washington Post:<br/><br/>\"The conspiracy charge was conspiracy to impede federal workers from doing their jobs. There was no evidence presented that these lowlifes specifically made statements to each other such as, \"Let's stop federal workers from doing their jobs.\" Zero evidence of the specific conspiracy charged. The juror who spoke to The Oregonian said they were frustrated that they were not presented with any charges that there was evidence for. <br/><br/>The other charges were all attached to the conspiracy charge, so when those failed all the charges failed. There were no separate charges, such as criminal trespass, that would have led to an easy conviction, but with a smaller penalty. <br/><br/>This could have been an easy case if the government had been willing to bring charges with penalties of under six years in prison. The government blew it. Awful.\" ",

I read a letter from juror number 4 trying to justify the verdict, who apparently you agree with. So if the Bundy clan occupy Crater Lake National park next and men are walking around with assault weapons, you'll be OK with it as long as you dont actually hear that they will shoot someone who stands qin their way. I used to think that Oregon was a place I'd want to visit.

				"commentBody": "Few things to note here:<br/><br/>1) Congress writes the tax laws. They can change them any time they wish<br/>2) Just because there is not authority doesn't mean it isn't a valid tax planning stalrategy. What that means is that it will just be tougher to defend under audit against the IRS and that the issue hadn't been litigated in the courts, regulations, revenue procedures, revenue rulings, or private letter rulings.<br/>3) Trump is under constant audit. Therefore every year in which he is audited, after its completion the IRS agrees with Trunp's taxable income or loss. Also, if you utilize an NOL in a future tax year the IRS can adjust that NOL even though the return in which it was generated is closed due to the statute of limitations. Therefore, even though this may have been an aggressive opinion after an audit the IRS has agreed that Trump has paid the appropriate amount of taxes due under the law.<br/>4) tax laws change every year. The research and development tax credit was just last year finally made permanent. Before that it had to be extended by congress every year. The point is if his position was allowable on the law in 1993 there is nothing illegal about it. If he tried to take that position now the yes there would be trouble. <br/><br/>In conclusion this report is a non-story.",

Rather, in tax law, there are dozens of shades of gray. And Trump's actions fall about as low as you can possibly get on the spectrum without being criminal. He used other people's losses and as his own. To say it another way, he hasn't been paying taxes for 20 years because other people lost money. Think about that. Does that make any sense? No. And it's not \"legal,\" it's just a stretch of one obscure tax law. The funniest part is that Trump is worth a fraction of what he claims to be worth, and he won't release his tax returns primarily because they would show he's been lying about his net worth for years. I am 100% sure of this. But people will elect him thinking he's a great businessman. His tax records would show more debt and less equity in his real estate holdings than you would ever believe. It's too bad no one in his accounting firm had the guts to come out and say it. They could doom the country through their (admittedly justified) cowardly inaction.",

The tax position taken by Trump that is in dispute is no where near the lowest levels of grey. <br/><br/>When an S Corp or LLC loses money, that loss flows to the personal returns of shareholders. Does not seem to me to be any grey there sir. Before 2002, bankruptcy did not flow through to the personal. Still not grey. <br/><br/>If institutions such as banks lent the company money instead of investing in equity than they do not have a stake and are at risk, which is why banks charge interest. It is payment for taking risk. Still not grey.<br/><br/>Trump's financial disclosure which is on file with the FEC gives way more information about his wealth than can be gleaned from his tax return. The only things in the tax return not contained in the disclosure is his tax rate, and how much he gave in charity. <br/><br/>Your argument is not grounded in fact or reality.",

If you default on your home loan and take a capital loss on your taxes, you can use that loss to offset capital gains in future years.  However, if the bank then forgives your loan, that portion of your loss has to be reconciled.  It only means a capital gain if you were such a savvy investor that your future gains exceeded those losses.  All these events are highly UNLIKELY because most people are not writing off their defaulted mortgages or making big capital gains.<br/><br/>So Trump did in fact cheat by writing off other investors' and lenders' losses as his own.  This has nothing to do with those who write the code.  There's a lot of nuance in the code, but you can't really get something that large for nothing.",
