I see her story as youthful idealism, first as a Goldwater Girl, then the Wellesley senior who challenged the slow pace of change (that one I would have gladly voted for). Then she got smitten by greed for money and power and didn't let idealism get in her way.<br/><br/>Then there's Bernie, of the same boomer generation, who also gained political prominence, who also aged and had grandchildren.  But he remained true to his ideals. The difference between the two has nothing to do with their generation; it has to do with who they really are.<br/><br/>And Trump? So as not to get censored, I'll just say he's one of a kind; not to be marked by/with any generation. ",

				"commentBody": " Democrats have also  bought into lower taxes and lack of investment in infrastructure. Obama has not proved to be a dove.  Obama's eight years are virtually over and we still blame Bush for Obama's failure to get us out of the Mid East quickly?  Hillary has only really double-downed appealing to the working class when she realized Trump was making inroads there. Neither she nor Bill came from super rich backgrounds but they do seem to have forgotten their roots.  <br/><br/>Mind you I am a Democrat and voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and have already cast my vote for Hillary.  She is the best alternative to a deranged demagogue.  But she is not the best the Dems could have put forward.  And I am not talking about Bernie.  Joe Biden is a person who has not forgotten his roots while growing with the times.  Don't forget he was out in front of Obama on same sex marriage.  No one could accuse him of what she is being accused of.  She is not clean, though hardly as dirty as Trump or some in the FBI would have us believe. <br/><br/>Yes, the Democrats are a far better alternative to Trump, Giuliani, Ryan et. al.  Saying that Trump's tax plan is inconsistent with what brought prosperity in the past is accurate.  But, \"voting accordingly\" for the alternative who does not really support high tax rates and understand the suffering of many in the working class including (gasp) less educated white makes is not entirely consoling.",

Also, their parents gave them a ton of advantages (unlimited device time), but didn't teach them a lot of skills that you and I learned or denied them certain freedoms we enjoyed (playing outside alone with friends, not having every minute scheduled). That's why they're more socially awkward/neurotic than we are and why they may come across as aloof (and therefore lazy), but that's on their parents. But due to the intense competitive pressures they face at every level now (school, job, etc.) the one thing that many of them are not, is lazy.",

				"commentBody": "\"Soccernomics\" argued through empirical analysis that football managers have little impact on team success.  The greatest predictor of team success is player wages.  That's a fact proven by science.  Fergie would not have won 13 titles managing Swansea.  Soccer is different than other sports.  It's free flowing (that's why I love it).  Player ingenuity generally wins matches.  It's certainly not micromanaged mid-match (anyone who's actually played knows this to be true).  I'd argue that a vocal centreback or keeper have more mid-match managerial control than the vaunted gaffers.  I think you give too much credit to Big Sam and Tony Pulis, and are way too harsh on Bradley (and I think Swansea was hard on Guidolin).  ",

				"commentBody": "Hm. It amazes me that even after more than 50 years, American media still puts Boomers in the predictable bracket. I suppose given the fact that the usual assumption that people are as two dimensional as media and its very brief attention spans is also rather predictable. <br/><br/>Just remember that the Boomers were the first to go outside the ancient system that doesn't work at all now and barely worked back then. The counterculture was quite real, and functional. <br/><br/>The main reason for overall regression on all subjects is that the media allows these primitive cave dwellers space on TV and the net. If you don't like ancient genocidal planet-destroying crocks, stop giving them so much credibility. If some nut on the street said half of what's come out of this election, they'd be locked up, not considered \"representative\" of anything. <br/><br/>Also stop presenting this unsightly mess as if it was some sort of Boomer idea. It wasn't, and isn't. \"Entitlement\" was fought for, like rights, meds prices and everything else, in the face of this grotesque tyranny of corruption and greed. What's happening is that those basic rights and entitlements are being stolen, every single day. If you want to be medieval serfs, wallowing in endless catastrophes, just keep ignoring the fact that this is happening now, not 50 years ago. <br/><br/>Keep blaming the past, and see what spectator criticism without action achieves. Zip. Nada. Nil. As for \"sunsets\", this garbage will be riding off in to it long before we do. ",

There's a reason his character has no name - because the name would give him away. And a whole lot of teased nudity for no good reason.
