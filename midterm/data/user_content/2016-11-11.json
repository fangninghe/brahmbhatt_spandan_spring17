Unfortunately, such seems to be the case for a majority of the Republican law makers.<br/>Interestingly, this willful ignorance puts them at odds with their conservative constituents. According to a poll conducted by ClearPath, conservatives DO favor taking measures against global warming. Take a look at the site below where you will find the link to a PDF with very precise questions on how Republican voters feel about global warming and what to do about it. The answers are astonishing.<br/><a href=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-national-poll-shows-strong-republican-support-for-clean-energy-policies-300150875.html\" title=\"http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-national-poll-shows-strong-republican-support-for-clean-energy-policies-300150875.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-national-poll-shows-strong-r...</a>",

Though my decision came prior to this election, this last year-and-a-half has totally \"radicalized\" me. I never felt comfortable, that I 'belonged', in the U.S., even after living in NY for almost 40 years, and I have sworn NEVER to set foot in the U.S. or its territories, especially my native Puerto Rico, again and I won't. I have severed all ties with the U.S except for bourbon, the one good thing that ever came out of there, by accident and violently \u2013 like the nation itself, born of fire.<br/><br/>\u201cI'm sorry if you don't like my honesty but, to be fair, I don't like your lies.\u201d ~ ANONYMOUS<br/><br/>Donald Trump's election has cemented it all.  He is no anomaly. Trump IS the U.S.A., Burdick and Lederer's 1958 classic \"The Ugly American\" personified:<br/>\"A mysterious change seems to come over Americans when they go to a foreign land. They isolate themselves socially. They live pretentiously. They are loud and ostentatious.\"<br/><br/>All the ugliness has finally come home to roost in Donald Trump!<br/><br/>To anyone attempting a smug reply to this comment (if published), say what you will.

I was in Syracuse just last weekend with a friend and we joked that it might be our last time in the States before we began building our border wall. We were joking because we were confident that the US would elect Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday. Given how things turned out, I'll be giving US visits a pass for the time being. I'm not trying to sound superior, as Canada is not perfect and we certainly have our problems. But as shock turns to sadness, I'm disappointed that nearly half of US voters would elect a man whose campaign relied on lies, slurs and fear mongering to the office of President.

Monsanto acknowledges climate change.  The Pentagon identifies climate change as a national security threat.  Engineers use models of climate change for stress tests.  Exxon-Mobil's own scientists predicted climate change back in the 70's.  The politically, financially motivated niche you speak of is not climatologists.....it's deniers.  But if you're honest with yourself, you already know that.     ",

Even the modelers admit that current models have no statistical skill in projecting regional temperatures or rainfall, and won't for at least another decade.  Not much of a sound basis for public policy.",

While the climate has changed over this planet's history, natural climate change tends to be slow, incremental.  Species have time to migrate or evolve.  Man-made climate change is so rapid, it is more akin to the cataclysmic events that set off mass extinctions.  ",
