				"commentBody": "The rest of you:<br/><br/>Trump should divest himself of the stock he has in the company at question. I imagine that it's run up rather much since last month's election, so he made a pretty intelligent investment; but we don't prohibit people from being elected president because they buy and sell stock.<br/><br/>As to the environment, we need a sensible national energy plan, that we've never had. Trump hasn't yet named an Energy Sec., and that department deals more with nuclear proliferation than anything else, but I hope that TRUMP'S Energy Dept. FNALLY will define an actionable plan that allows us to provide for a manageable transition to less polluting forms of energy. However, for the time being, the U.S. already does more in this vein than almost anyone else and at immense expense, it doesn't seem to be saving the coral, and the growing energy needs of the world over the next generation won't be met by windmills.<br/><br/>Maybe Russia might consider drilling less oil and gas and building fewer pipelines. Here, we need jobs and energy.",

				"commentBody": "As we are beginning to see, Trump does not laugh, smile or make funny comments. He has demanded that SNL \"Retire\" its recent skit. He was upset about the incident at the Hamilton Play. He has even sued the writer of his biography that he gave an interview to.<br/><br/>He has commented of tweeted that is is wrong to criticize the president, or make fun of him, he is as many have observed, a narcissist. He can not stand being made fun of, and calls any criticism of him unfair. He has a fractured ego, it is the personality of a schoolyard bully. The best way we have to keep him in check is to make fun of him constantly, he will crack.<br/><br/>But watching him reveals more than just a narcissist. He has swindled workers, contractors, and investors, claims it is just good business, he does not distinguish between right and wrong, between moral and immoral, he has no conscience, it is the personality of a sociopath. It is easy to believe he would have you killed if he thought he could get away with it.<br/><br/>Watch him speak to his crowds, his facial expressions, it is like facing Dirty Harry, he wants to intimidate his viewers, not convince them. His followers respond in kind, letting you know they like intimidating you, not leading you telling you what he is going to do, not what you should do or why. <br/><br/>Yes he speaks , acts , gestures like, a Fascist, just like those preceding him, and his followers like it that way. We have to laugh him away,  he will try to retaliate with force. ",

It points out the delicacy with which media treat those with power.   There's a sharp difference between calling one sentence a lie, and calling a man a \"liar\".   The second brands the man as a type of person who lies all the time.   After so very many lies for a full campaign season, that would not be an extreme step...but they won't take it.<br/><br/>What this issue and Ms. Spayd's column reveal is the tortuous backflips that the media go through when choosing the language they use when describing those in power, their extreme reluctance to come out and state their own very obvious conclusions about them, their...deference.<br/><br/>The right's preferred term for the most powerless in the community, \"illegal  immigrants\", on the other hand, does get some use.",

No matter the explanation, the descriptions, the analysis, the \"fair reporting.\" They were, all of them, very wrong and it took a war to prove that so. <br/><br/>Being careful to be unbiased, with a person like the Orange Man, a person like any other dictator, is always a mistake. Likewise with his cronies and their \"movement\". There are times when a paper should be fair and unbiased to protect all opinions, as in a free country we expect. This is not one of those times. To anyone with eyes and ears, the people of the incoming administration are going to pulverize all social systems put into place since FDR, and do so with impunity. They will jeopardize the entire globe. <br/><br/>Ms. Spayd, unless you think these people are going to \"do good things\" for the country and the planet, worrying about words and how they are used is not some trivial pursuit by those who are holding the NYT to a hard line. Rather, it is absolutely necessary that this paper, the flagship for true democracy, be straight-forward and direct, even if other papers are not. <br/><br/>Words and terms are the only power we have. It cannot be that \"balanced and fair reporting\" of a thug, a thief and a control freak can co-exist. The descriptions of The Orange Man need to be blunt, hard-nosed and consistent. Explanations after the fact don't help. Nothing else is acceptable. ",

Choosing the right words is literally your job. The NYT's obsession with \"nuance\" at the expense of the truth is increasingly absurd. Disguising white supremacy as populism is not a neutral choice; even if it were, there is nothing morally superior about neutrality in the face of bigotry. Trying to see the \"gray\" in the views of a racist, sexist xenophobe who is currently in a position of political power is not \"braver than flat-out proclaiming someone a racist\" - maybe the NYT needs to be reminded of how well appeasement worked out for Neville Chamberlain...
