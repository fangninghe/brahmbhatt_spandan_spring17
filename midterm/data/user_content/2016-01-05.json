Ross simply assumes that Iran is the greater threat and insists therefore the U.S. Has no choice but to continue to supper the House of Saud. It's actually refreshing to see him do so, because it so neatly illustrates the workings of the de facto Zionist-Salafist alliance that U.S. Foreign policy in the region has been built on. Al Qaeda, the Taliban, ISIS, and even Hamas, are all the offspring of this perverse policy of supporting arch/reactionary Sunni elites and racist Jewish settler colonialism against the legitimate aspirations of the region's peoples.",

Don't underestimate the ability of the rising middle class, the more educated and internationally exposed, continously growing educated elite, to see through the bull^%$ of official propaganda.   The CCP is the proverbial child with the finger in the dike.  Unfortunately, some of their mistakes will do irreparable damage even after they exit from the stage:  cancer rates from pollution, damaged soil and water tables contaminated with heavy metals, etc.   For that there will be a future \"truth and reconciliation commission.\"   At that point the red elites will and their offspring will be well settled overseas, and a new generation of elites will spring up, perhaps more controlled, situated in a more balanced political-economic structure.    In the meantime, the greatest threat is that the CCP manipulates nationalism to a fever pitch to perpetuate their rule  -- patriotism is the last refuge of a party without any other source of legitimacy.  The U.S. and other countries in Asia must take a principled without being pulled into a game of manipulated domestic perception forming which is being carefully controlled and played out by the Politburo in Zhongnanhai.",

A diverse cadre of leaders can further policies and implement strategies within their communities aimed at decreasing disparity.  As much as we like to see it otherwise, one of the chief goals of higher education is to develop leaders of tomorrow.  And these leaders need to be diverse.  <br/><br/>For states that have derailed Affirmative Action, ongoing data will inform more potent and specific recruitment strategies.  The data seems to show that each state and each flagship school has its own private school competitors, its own incentives systems, and its unique existing school/student relationship.  Ann Arbor will experience more competition from competitive private schools than Austin, hence, their strategy was to scale 'yield'.  Austin will have to come up with their own strategy.  There is no size that fits all.  Informed by a good needs assessment, the solution will be adequately tailored to the school.  <br/><br/>It is hopeful to see Michigan successfully increase class diversity.  It will be a harder task to move beyond the controlled environment of the college campus to the real world.  How can we translate university diversity to improved societal equity?    ",

The other side is to a have a test results based selection criterium, which will exclude the creative thinking, artistic applicants in favor of the \"study for test\" high scoring achievers. What would be the selection criterion then, to ensure that race has nothing to do with the selection process?",

				"commentBody": "Any type of social policy that equitably rights the wrongs of America's entrenched legacy of discriminatory racial practices will come at the expense of the majority. That is the real reason why the masses oppose AA - it threatens white America's sense of entitlement, the feeling that they've \"earned\" a seat at the table. Never mind the centuries of policies enacted to rig the system in their favor. <br/><br/>The alternative to AA, and admittedly the best solution, is to radically reform America's K-12 education system; specifically by eliminating property taxes as the main funding source for school districts. How is it fair that high-income districts get to have the best school systems, keep all their resources to themselves, and severely restrict households with section-8 housing vouchers from living in their affluent school district? In order to level the playing field, we need to redistribute funding and talent (teachers) to underperforming schools. But capitalists would never support such drastic social justice measures, and so we have AA. ",
