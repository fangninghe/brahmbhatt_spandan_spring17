				"commentBody": "It may be that the vast majority of protesters are peaceful, but this protest developed pretty much as all others have \u2013 violence, looting and general mayhem that precipitated a strong police response that in turn affected everyone protesting. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect those responsible for enforcing the law and ensuring order to stand aside and allow a city to be damaged and lives and property endangered because some wish to protest injustice.<br/><br/>That said, we can expect this to replayed again and again across America, until we find a way for cops to enforce the law without shooting unarmed blacks. It\u2019s that simple.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re white and middle-class or more prosperous, American law enforcement works tolerably well at the local level. If you\u2019re not white and you\u2019re working-class or poor, it doesn\u2019t, unless one accepts that the only way to maintain order in these communities is by controlling them through overbearing force. It\u2019s clear that this is no longer tolerable by most of America, not just by our African American communities.<br/><br/>Changing mindsets and tactics, training, supervision and even replacing some cops with others, are not processes that are going to happen overnight; but until they do we can expect additional tragedies and peaceful protests marred by violence that authorities are forced to put down.<br/><br/>But cops must make a serious start.",

I don't want to point fingers and I don't knkow where the blame lies, but it is remarkable. We should have been at a point in this campaign when a desperate GOP would be fracturing around the shipwreck of a Trump candidacy, with ramifications up and down the ballot. Instead, they are closing ranks and maintaining a very strong position in congressional races. There's still time, maybe this will change, and maybe Secretary Clinton will rise and be able to exploit the willingness of GOP politicians to stand with Trump. I hope so, but I fear there will have been a huge missed opportunity to throw the GOP into well-deserved disarray.",

Belittled by Trump, in the most personal of attacks against his family and his wife, he still finds himself able to pull the lever for this man who may be the most dangerous of all presidential candidates in memory.  What now do we think of Ted Cruz?  Here is my conclusion.  He is now thinking beyond this election.  If there is any way to co-opt Trump's supporters after this election relegates Trump to the trash heap of history, Cruz is now thinking he can be that person.  Sad that he would sink so low, but he is nothing but ambitious.  In four years, let us consider his change of mind on Trump as his epiphany.  Power at any cost, including his soul.  ",
