				"commentBody": "I am a member of the Times\u2019 liberal readership and happen to agree with many, though not all, its editorial positions.  Yet I have found the lack of clear boundaries between reportage, analysis and opinion very troubling. This is a situation that seems to be particularly acute during this heated political season.  I have no qualms about an editorial or opinion piece presenting a point of view, wherever it may be on the political spectrum\u2014that\u2019s  the rightful function of op-ed writing.  Articles clearly marked as \u2018analysis\u2019 also can be expected to contain an interpretation of data or a conclusion.<br/>However I have been concerned by the increasing amount of straight news articles\u2014those expected to simply present information based on observation and/documentable data\u2014that reflect the particular opinion of the reporter.  This is often done in subtle ways.  Inserting an adjective or two in a bland line of straight reportage certainly flavors the meaning of the text.  Unfortunately, there have been many articles (reportage, not analysis or opinion pieces) over the past months that left me in no doubt of the author\u2019s bias.<br/>However subtle it may be, bias doesn\u2019t belong in reporting.   I appreciate receiving news articles that present the unvarnished facts, fully and accurately reported, so that I can draw my own conclusions.  When I want analysis and opinion, I will go to articles that present these.   Why are these journalistic boundaries so blurred at the Times? ",

True objective reporting is much more credible and powerful. Maybe its a reflection of journalism/media today that feel they have to have a point of view to attract readership/viewership. If it continues we will all suffer from not being challenged out of our biases.",

What I still remember is my feeling after my comment did not make to publishing as usual. I was like: Wow, even my comment was not liberal enough to appear among readers' comments?!<br/><br/>For this matter, I want to give Vanessa Friedman a big credit for her article on Malania Trump's dress she wore to give her speech at the RNC to nominate her husband.<br/><br/>In her article, Ms. Friedman appraised Mrs. Trump's choice of her outfit and she wrote in a very professional and convincing way. I love her article and believe the politically neutral way Ms. Friedman writes about fashion and style is the right way the Times should uphold.<br/><br/>It's probably the reason that I love NYT's Lifestyle section and I hope NY Times continue to try to appeal to a broader audience/readership, not only by its Lifestyle section but throughout all its sections, except for the Opinion and the Editorial.<br/><br/>Thanks again for this \"The Public Editor\" column and for Ms. Friedman's very professional and beautiful writings!",

							"commentBody": "It's especially obvious in the case of straight-news articles (as opposed to editorials) on hot-button topics on which the NYT has taken a strong stand, such as illegal (yes, not undocumented, illegal) immigration. If you check out the Times Picks, frequently you will find that, even if the comments as a whole are heavily weighted against the NYT editorial position, the NYT Picks will almost all be in favour of the NYT's position; they may salt the Picks with a handful of contrary comments, but they will not pick the strongest or best argued - hard to avoid the conclusion that they deliberately chose weaker comments in order to load the dice. Then, as soon as Picks are chosen, that becomes the default view, so anyone clicking on comments sees those first, and no doubt many don't click to 'all', assuming that these really are the 'best'. (If 'Pick' isn't intended to be perceived as 'best', why is the Pick designed as a gold medal, like 'best in show'? in fact, why not just assign Picks at random, if the designation isn't meant as a mark of quality or a recommendation?)<br/>One first step in addressing the perception of bias would simply be to change the default view of comments to 'all' from 'Picks'. (BTW I've had quite a few Picks.)",

							"commentBody": "\"My take is that if anything the PE is too soft on them, and is generally brushed off with some kind of mealy-mouthed self-justification, or a promise to change...\"<br/><br/>I guess I don't think the public editors are soft on them, but I do think the responses to the public editor could be much better. When I commented that some journalists seem to get upset when the public editor makes inquiries, I should have also added the word \"defensive\". There have been times when the attitude from an editor/reporter is \"We're sorry if you were offended\"; or the one that I really think is unprofessional: \"The readers obviously didn't get it.\" (We got it. You just messed up.)<br/><br/>But my suggestion in the earlier comment is to not assume all of the journalists are like that and approach them in queries as \"already guilty as a group\". Find the ones who may have used inappropriate judgment and focus on that - as Ms. Spayd did with Patrick Healy on that Bill Clinton speech.  <br/><br/>And yes, I see his editor has a spin of the story \"may have made readers uncomfortable\". I guess that's the new \"you just didn't get it.\" Maybe that should be the focus: I think some of the editors don't realize they can edit stuff  the reporters write. When Alessandra Stanley wrote about Shonda Rhimes, the uproar was not only about what she wrote but that three editors read it - and it still was published in all its offensive glory.",

As I read your piece, I found myself nodding along in agreement with the points you make.It also struck me that a central point, that we still don't know Hillary Clinton,though she has been out there in plain view doing and advocating, and suffering  endless criticism,is also tied up with our generation of women working hard to make change, but not doing enough to claim credit for it.The younger generation has it all over on us, where claiming credit is concerned. I do feel that this failure to take credit has added to a lack of confidence in her. It's unfortunate &amp; undeserved.<br/><br/>I was first aware of Hillary Clinton in the 80s, as a young mother struggling to figure life out while working and raising small children. An article in Time Magazine about her, at that time first lady of Arkansas, was about how she was trying to change education in Arkansas, to bring up achievement and mastery levels in a state that was at the bottom of the rankings. I was so impressed by the fact that she was also a working attorney while First Lady, and really felt inspired by her. There were not that many high profile women in any domain during that era of the mid 80's. She gave me hope, working in highly male dominated field, as I was, that I, too, could succeed. I still have that magazine and the article. <br/><br/>I find myself feeling quite emotional at the prospect of her actual nomination for President. She has earned it. She deserves it. We need her to win it!",

The extreme right wing FOX's are just as guilty at refusing to remain neutral by interjecting their own brand of truth (their truth) propaganda in order sway public opinion AND garner ever more corporate ad $$$.<br/>Yet the American public continues to feed the media monster.   We no longer value integrity and honesty in people,  politicians,  our once fair and unbiased American institutions.  It's all about \"winning\".   And,  our children watch us,  lie,  cheat and obfuscate.   What a pity.",
