				"commentBody": "A strange man chasing a woman in the forest is not the same thing as courtship or sex. <br/><br/>How do you not get that that behavior would be threatening to women in the real world, outside a propagandist film? <br/><br/> I'm pretty sick and tired of men--all men, of every ethnicity--that hear people like Donald Trump or about athletes assaulting women, men catcalling or chasing after women, and discuss it as \"sex\". Sex implies mutual consent. There is plenty of disgust for consensual interracial sex, and yes, the film is offensive because it implies black men can only express their \"sexuality\" through predation sullying whiteness. <br/><br/>The behavior you're describing is that of a predator, not benign \"sexuality\" you're attempting to defend. None of which justifies the film and the conflation of black men with rape. ",

				"commentBody": "It always annoys me, a tolerant atheist, when my fellow atheists blame religion. Since history began, 90% of people are religious in one way or another.<br/><br/>What is this so-called Christian religion? It's relevant to Mr. Orner's problem. I spent nearly a decade as a deeply committed Christian in a progressive Christian community (several, actually) seeking as best I could to understand why I was there and what it meant.<br/><br/>I read the Gospels over and over, and came to love Isaiah, which is beautiful poetry. There are, of course, the psalms, hymns, music, art, and a lot of community outreach (soup kitchen and other ways of helping people, visiting the sick, mentoring and just plain enjoying life).<br/><br/>These activities I assume would be normal for any church. But what is puzzling is the flat out stubborn ignorance about what we know about the life of Jesus as represented in the Gospels.  (I never cared much for Paul, but he's not all bad.) The Jesus of the Gospels contradicts what these so-called evangelicals, particularly those who support Trump, appear to believe.<br/><br/>The Gospels are short and repetitive, and there is no mistake about the message. It is not a message that says you should hate anyone, or exclude anyone, or hurt anyone, or that wealth is a sign of god's favor and poverty a sign of rejection.<br/><br/>The salespeople who say different are simply not Christian. They are exploiters.<br/><br/>The ecstasy at Trump meetings looks religious. We all want leadership, but he is just a con man.",

				"commentBody": "I don't know Mr. Comey's motivations nor does anyone else. A few months ago Democrats were falling all over him because he exonerated Hillary, sort of. Now he is a partisan Republican hack. A few facts..he was appointed by George Bush but Barack Obama has kept him in his job for nearly 8 years.  Mrs. Clinton put the private server in her basement and this is not the same as using Gmail or Yahoo as Mr. Powell and a few others did. Carlos Danger, aka Anthony Weiner, is under investigation and some Clinton emails were discovered on his wife and his computer and devices. A graphic in today's paper outlines the tortured release of emails by the Clinton Camp. Not a great record of transparency.<br/><br/>All of these are facts not conspiracy theories. In classic Clinton fashion the attack squad begins against Mr. Comey. Soon we will learn that 25 years ago he made an unwanted advance on someone, watches XXX rated movies, and is a sociopath. This is the Clinton way. However the facts remain that she brought this on herself. She should be 40 points ahead of Trump but is clearly not considered trustworthy except, apparently, by many of the commenters at the NYT.",

Now he is a partisan Republican hack.<br/><br/>And a few months ago Republicans were saying he was a Democratic hack.  Now they are falling all over him because he has put Hillary in a bind.  <br/><br/>All depends on which side you're on, and that's a serious problem for our country.  It's one thing to have this or that prescription for what ails the country depending on your political philosophy.  It's quite another to base a whole election, a whole political system (as has been the case the last eight years) on who is in or running for office (Obama, Clinton, Trump) instead of what they stand for.  Mr. Trump insisted that we view him as the best candidate not because of what he would do (which he was very vague about or waffled on) but on who he was.  Unfortunately, we bought into this, whichever side we are on.  Because the voters don't want to get into policy details and their likely outcomes, Ms. Clinton too saw this approach as the easiest and surest path to victory: focus on Mr. Trump's personality and temperament, unsuited for office.  How many people, even Hillary supporters, can recite her position on Syria?  How would she tweak the ACA to make it work better?  How is that different from what Trump would do in replacing the ACA?  Now, do you know the name of the Miss Universe he dissed and what his criticism of her was? What did Hillary say about that? See?  That, you know.",

				"commentBody": "Powell makes a strong case.  But here's a couple of things that struck me as I read - neither detracting from the argument he makes:<br/><br/>Powell says C. Counsell was a \"nice enough\" infielder - that's quite the Obamaesque put down, as in \"Hillary, she's likeable enough\", though Counsell played 16 years in the Majors and had some thrilling successes- something very few players do.<br/><br/>Powell also questions the Latino roots of one of the people in pipe-line.  That quip reminded me of Senator Warren's claims to a Native American heritage.  Maybe the gentleman characterizes himself as Hispanic so that he (in baseball), like Warren (in academia and politics), can get some notoriety and a boost in a very competitive business.<br/><br/>All that said, certainly baseball can pull as many mediocre managers from the minority pool as it can from the white.  MLB might even find a genius or two.<br/>Someone like Francona who knows that the best time to use your best reliever is when you really need him, not when \"the book\" says he \"should\" be used.",

Already six points adrift of Bayern, and behind early season upstarts Energy Drink Leipzig, Koln and Hertha, they already are at a crucial juncture where they're going to have to beat bitter rival Schalke going into the return, home to Sporting Clube.<br/>Tuchel has to get his teams right for both matches, neither of which look to be a layup.",

He first caught the SDT\u2019s secret committee\u2019s attention when he publicly spanked Hillary Clinton last July, when announcing that no charges would be recommended against Clinton regarding her handling of classified emails. Republicans expressed public hostility towards Comey for not recommending charges. Privately they were somewhat succored by the chastisement Comey issued and it was whispered that \"SDT committee members saw potential in Comey\". They reportedly became convinced in Comey\u2019s value with his recent announcement that the FBI would be investigating emails Huma Abedin sent from her disgraced husband Anthony Wiener\u2019s computer, for possible ties to the Clinton email investigation. SDT members are alleged to have been overheard making references to the movie Godfather Two. Parallels were drawn between movie character Hyman Roth boasting to Michael Corleone that their syndicate now owned their own Third World Country -Cuba in the movie; Red State America in real life- and that the day was coming for them to see their own candidate elected for President.",

				"commentBody": "Not only was this puzzle not in my wheelhouse, I felt as if there was a sign on it saying Deadline Not Welcome.<br/><br/>Remarkably, I got the theme, such as it was, pretty early.  Fairly recently there was a puzzle entry clued with reference to a MAC OS, and I didn't understand it until some WPer (MTFT I think) explained it.  So after I saw the LION and the TIGER, along with the beginning MAC, I figured maybe MAC had taken to naming its OSs after big cats.  (I have pretty much avoided having to use MACs since c. 1999-2000, and I didn't know that the MAC people had found some reason to give their OSs cutesy names.  Even if I used a MAC regularly, I doubt I'd have had any interest in learning those names.  Ick.)<br/><br/>But even more off-putting was the overwhelming number of entries clued with reference to pop music, most of which I'd never heard of.  It really felt as if solvers over the age of about 25 should just go tend to their knitting.  And CHEETAH GIRLS managed to hit both inside MAC and inside pop music at the same time.<br/><br/>I've been rather ill for the past couple of days and not up to doing puzzles.  I eventually did the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday puzzles, and did get around to reading Deb's and Jeff's columns, but haven't yet caught up on reading the comments.  So it'll be too late for me to add my bit.  I do hope that hasn't destroyed anyone's day!<br/><br/>I hope everyone else enjoyed this puzzle more than I did.",

Congress would tear him to shreds.<br/>Now, he releases the e-mails. Even if Clinton is elected, Congress will be satiated and he will be safe.<br/>Of course, if there is any justice in the world, he will be fired on Nov. 9 regardless of the outcome of the election.",
