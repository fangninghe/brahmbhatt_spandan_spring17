Quibbling about the exact temperature at a particular time is not a good argument, petty and beside the point. Daily spot temp is unhelpful at best, we're talking weeks. But there is that silly Arthopolis site that has had the same temperature for several years now; apparently Russian temps require a careful looksee.<br/><br/>\"Temperatures have soared in western Russia\u2019s Yamal tundra this summer. Across Siberia, some provinces warmed an additional 10 degrees Fahrenheit beyond normal. In the fields, large bubbles of vegetation appeared above the melting permafrost \u2014 strange pockets of methane or, more likely, water. Record fires blazed through dry Russian grassland.<br/><br/>\"In one of the more unusual symptoms of unseasonable warmth, long-dormant bacteria appear to be active.

Your comment reminds me of something about the forest and the trees.  You know.<br/><br/>Dan, thanks for the support and the documentation.  I could add things like the salt tax, which was a burden to poor people for the obvious reason and possibly also because nobility were often exempted from taxes (\"if I remember correctly\").  Worse, the salt tax varied dramatically from one region to another for no reason except random variation in historical development of taxation.  In sum, as far as my lack of expertise can say, it seems to have been an irrational system.",

I have read the literature on spinal fusion and agree that there is no statistical proof of spinal fusion's benefit. <br/><br/>The clinical studies are extremely limited. The largest I found randomized two arms each of 38 patients. As my symptoms worsened, I began to lose the reflexes in my left arm. In order to avoid pain, I had to stop physical therapy and become basically debilitated. (I had been diligent in physical therapy for 2 1/2 months prior to this.) I had surgery on Jan 4th. Immediately post surgery, I lost the persistent numbness and tingling. my reflexes improved. Pain dramatically decreased. I got a lot better.<br/><br/>I don't think that the patients who have the worst symptoms are willing to be randomized. I was willing to undergo surgery even with a limited expectation of benefit. It concerns me greatly that anyone - clinician, insurance exec or public health official - would consider the available evidence as proof that cervical spinal fusion surgery is not effective.

I think that when Ms. Clinton wins the presidency,  we will see, hear, and read more sexist and misogynistic views. <br/><br/>That's why I think it's good that Ms. Clinton is tough, aggressive, controlled and has a thick skin (everything thatDonald Trump is not) -- she's been through 11 hours of Benghazi testifying and came out of it unscathed. I hope she can handle 4 years of worse than that. ",

Trump might enjoy ripping a critic/competitor's \"throat out,\" as Michael says here. But it's only because of who he has been allowed to become -- a vessel for a scary bunch of resentful people who were left behind in the economic recovery.<br/><br/> Oh, also the ultra-rich 1 percent.  Those guys will never get rich enough.<br/> But the shrewd maker of big deals that Trump has tried to brand himself as -- no way. How many bankruptcies has he filed? How many employees and contractors has he stiffed? And -- big surprise -- he won't release his tax returns.<br/><br/>All that, plus he's so thin-skinned he publically got mad a mother and her crying baby at a rally. I mean, really. ",

Look at Barry Bonds: he's Miami's hitting coach, and he's never really admitted anything about juicing. ARod doesn't shy away from it anymore, and you don't even have to wait for an interviewer to bring it up. Somebody suggested asking his teammates what they think of him. It's been done, often, and the vast majority of them feel lucky to be on the same team as he is. I think even Jeter has made up with him. He's got one of the greatest baseball IQ's in history, and he seems to have learned what Bonds, Pete Rose and a lot of others never did about taking responsibility. Sometimes you can learn more about what not to do from someone who did it than from someone who never did. Now, if he's still a slumlord, that's another story, but in baseball, if the new ARod is for real, the game, and the team, should take advantage of what he has to give.",
