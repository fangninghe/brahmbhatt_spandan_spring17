				"commentBody": "In an interview with a former OAS gunman for whom \"attentats\" against the FLN and European liberals were his \"pain quotidien\" in 1962, during the final year of \"Algerie francaise,\"he summed up the shadow war between the 2 urban guerrilla  armies succinctly by saying,\"Moi, je te tue; toi, tu me tues.\" Bref, tit for tat.Same could be said for our combined air and ground war against the Islamic State. The more we attack them the more inclined they r to retaliate by conducting massacres in Shite quarters in Baghad and the West.VP Biden, speaking with prescience, said that the ultimate solution lay in partition.A starting point towards this end would be to declare a unilateral truce, and cease offensive operations against the Islamic State. Perhaps if we commit to leaving them alone, they will cease to launch terrorist assaults against us, and the victims of the carnages at CHARLEY HEBDO, in Paris centre, San Bernardio and in Orlando would be alive today.Give peace a chance, and a peaceful coexistence might be achieved.Both sides r suffering due of the intransigence of our military and the Iranian backed militias.DIPLOMACY is worth a try.ISIS fighters r like the Palestinians generations ago, when TE LAWRENCE said they were like rain, and you cannot capture  rain.Militarily, we will never defeat ISIS. Better to learn to live with the Caliphate as the first step to dividing the country into separate spheres. ISIS is not going away soon. Its demise is not announced for tomorrow.",

				"commentBody": "So, Mr. NRA Gun Lobby, just what are the benefits that we are getting from  your efforts, in exchange for these lives? What advantages of easy access to guns balance out the disadvantage of 53 young beautiful lives destroyed by hot lead bullets? Or the 32 at Virginia Tech? The 26 at Newtown, Conn?  Point out those advantages for us please. What compromise have been made, which lawmakers have been rewarded, in exchange for the tens of thousands of lives lost to easy firepower in the recent past? Are you getting a good deal for your efforts? Are your bosses satisfied with your work? Are the profits adequate? Is the ideology working out for you? Do you think it's improving life for the rest of us? Do you think it's working out for the people of Orlando right now? ",

				"commentBody": "Right.  As the Red Queen said to Noam Chomsky, \"Words mean what I say they mean.\" Indeed, look at the AR-15 rifles at Big 5 Sporting Goods: they are .223 single shots, SEMI auto.  Far less lethal than a perfectly legal semi-automatic shotgun.  Changing an AR-15 to full auto is a felony in many jurisdictions, and armor-piercing ammo for it is restricted too (while 12-gauge buckshot is not restricted at all.) Only police agencies have full auto, military-grade M-16s, right in their patrol cars. They are not civilian AR-15's.",

The Second Amendment does not specifically mention the ownership or use of semi-automatic assault weapons or, interestingly enough, self defense.  <br/><br/>Kid you not.  Here's the exact wording:  \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"   Read it and think.  Maybe weep for the ones who died this morning.  And don't forget the little kids at Sandy Hook.  Spare a tear for them too.  ",

The only differences are that he was stopped from carrying out his plans, and he appears not to be Muslim.<br/><br/>Guns and hatred are the common threads here. Radical Islam is also a problem we must face, but your suggestion that liberals and gays are in cahoots to rationalize terrorism as a way to make a political point is way off the mark. We can't control people's minds. We can control the guns, if our leaders will step up to the plate.",
