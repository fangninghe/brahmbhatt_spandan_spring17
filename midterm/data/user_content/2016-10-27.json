				"commentBody": "Ironically, the professional game of American football has become faster, harder hitting and more athletic . . . YET, more tedious to watch.<br/><br/>1.  This season has had an inordinate # of lackluster match ups.   Overall team play seems robotic with individual players making mind numbingly, stupid infractions -- holding, off sides &amp; personal fouls -- which kill potential scoring drives.  <br/><br/>2.  In the NFL's effort to promote a passing offense game (to make it more exciting to watch), the opposite has resulted.  The few teams with smart coaching (i.e.. NE Patriots w/ Bill Belichick) have created a offense scheme based on high percentage, short throws to behemoth tight ends.  7-20 yards \"dink &amp; dunk\" stuff.   Further encouraging this are the restraints put on the defensive backs. Pass interference is continually called in NFL games.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a smart way to win . . .  plus it saves on your QB . . . but it's a yawn of a game.  Seasonal passing yardage, completion % &amp; TD #s have skyrocketed -- yet the \"elite\" QBs today would not have lasted 8 seasons in the NFL of the 1960s &amp; '70s.    ",

				"commentBody": "Well, if these STOLEN or FAKED emails are genuine in any way, they reflect the very same discussions that take place inside the New York Times, inside any company, entity, foundation, or other organization that frets and worries and screams over anything that could possibly go wrong. This is the sort of stuff that goes on anywhere people worry, argue, and come to eventual consensus. But the press, including even the vaulted New York Times, doesn't mind painting such internal squabbles any way they see fit. And do remember, these are STOKEN or FAKED documents (because the press certainly doesn't know or care). This is rubbish reporting. Worse still, in the shadow of Trump's colossal misdeeds, misogyny, and pathological lies, this is a diversion tactic. The destruction of American society that a Trump Presidency would guarantee is the real focus or should be. And that is what will be decided on November 8th. The very heart and soul of this nation is on the line. Twelve days before that fateful moment arrives is no time for impressionist interpretations of internal arguments in Clinton's camp. I, for one, am highly impressed that her organization hashed this all out in bold, forthright, even downright nasty terms. That's how the best decisions are always made.<br/><br/>Wish the company I work for had those kind of guts.",

				"commentBody": "Thank you for writing this. I am glad you survived to tell the story.<br/><br/>This is a day in the life... the real life of soldiers and journalists in the modern war zone.  This is not \"Rah Rah\" Support The Troops glamorous: it's grim and ugly, and tedious - because this same routine goes on and on, as does the danger.<br/><br/>Trump says, \"I love war\" - and his fans love it and cheer. Why? Trump hasn't got a wisp of a clue about any of this! Current evidence leans towards the sad fact that he probably can't find Iraq on a map. We need a President who knows that war is not fun, and is a high risk roulette exercise at best, with the odds against you almost all the time. That is not Trump. We can't even be sure Trump could greet the Fallen on their arrival back home, without making it all about himself, or one of his hotels. He even thinks nuclear war is entirely viable! He is not alone in his war lust. Many GOTP candidates openly mused which country they would go to war with \"on day one of my Administration\" - and most on the Right saw nothing wrong with it.<br/><br/>It's past time for an article like this to be published again in the NYT. Sadly, this sequence of events leading up to a car bomb has happened so many times before. It's resulted in troops coming home in grey caskets or strapped to gurneys with tubes coming out all over, and a shattered life to rebuild. We need to remember... all of us. This is what our troops face when they go on a Mideast tour. It's why we should cherish them.",

So glad Bryan Denton survived. Be safe, Bryan!<br/>This war causes so many thoughts to flood into my head (most of them anger at Bush the Second for fraudulently starting this terrible war) that I feel the two predominant ones are just random, but here goes:<br/>1. Can we really not get a helmet for all of our allied soldiers? I know four-year-olds riding bikes on suburban streets who take more safety precautions. (There must be some explanation for the lack of helmets, but it is hard to imagine that it is sensible.)<br/>2. The U.S. damn well better stand by the Kurds in their struggle for independence because they have been our toughest allies for a long, long time in extremely dirty conflict. We abandoned them under Reagan, and again under Bush the First. It's time we did right by these people and helped them achieve independent nation status so they are not subjected to nationalistic tyranny again! P.S. Let's not let the Turks' demands cause us to forsake the Kurds again. I believe smart diplomacy can make it happen.",

The Chinese especially have no intention of letting themselves be contained, and seek to expand their influence. And I fear that Clinton may feel it necessary to use foreign policy as a horsewhip on the Republican party, i.e. make the case that they are aiding and abetting the Chinese and Russians.
