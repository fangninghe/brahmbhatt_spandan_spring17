				"commentBody": "NJ Transit has chronically been shortchanged by NJ politicians, but it's gotten much much worse during the Christie regime, when he has repeatedly cut NJ's share of funding for the trains (causing huge fare hikes), refused Federal funds for train project like the Hudson River Tunnel project (did THAT money even get repaid to the Feds?), generally refused to do anything about the states's crumbling infrastructure, trains, and roads, and even grasped any monies meant for these sorts of projects to \"balance\" his budgets!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, he's busy cutting windfall \"settlements\" with the likes of Exxon Mobil costing the state of NJ literally $billions!  (The Exxon deal along cost NJ over $8 BILLION, settling a $8.9 fine for $225 million!)   <br/><br/>All these NJ Transit catastrophes stem from a lack of funding and safety updating!  Put the blame where it belongs: on Christie!",

							"commentBody": "New Jersey and New York make billions of dollars in fees from various transportation schemes which includes The Port Authority of NY and NJ. There's the NJ Turnpike Authority, The NY Thruway Authority, The Delaware Ports Authority and more.<br/>What happens to the revenues from these transportation management systems? The NJTP was opened in 1949. Surely those bonds are redeemed by now? And yes I know there have been improvements but when was the last time you saw an improvement? Especially on the South Jersey end? The Delaware Memorial Bridge was a one bridge route for decade, how long ago was the second bridge added? You can spend a lot of time looking at the accounting for these piggy banks and come up with no answers.<br/>How much do the fees and fares keep increasing and why does none of it go to infrastructure improvements? Hundreds of toll collector jobs were eliminated by EZPASS. After the machinery was paid for where did the money go?<br/>Part of the problem is that each of these systems has become a fief of it's own. Some have millions in reserves some are short. Politics determine where a lot of it is spent.<br/>It is past time to look at the two states and see if combining these pools of money could do more. And road use taxes on gasoline should be going to roads not building commuter rail and bus routes. Let the users of these systems pay the cost through their ticket stubs.<br/>Better yet, sell all of them to private industry with strict oversight over profits and improvements. ",

On Hudson Line , third rail power is provided but not for certain sections. <br/><br/>This requires a constant jumble of different designed self powered cars for the different elctrified sections with a mix of Diesel locomotives to fill in the gaps. <br/><br/>That means both push and pull Diesel power is used as was the case at Hoboken. Remote control appears to have failed here, with locomotive pushing without brakes applied. <br/><br/>The design is ancient and maintenance is poor, we need a \"moon shot\" to get up to 21st century.
