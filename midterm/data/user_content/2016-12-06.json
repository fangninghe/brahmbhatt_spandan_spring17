What if the new invented jobs do not come? Instead of alleviating hardship, automation has helped the expansion of precocity of employment, particularly at lower levels that keep being automated. Now it is the middle classes and clerks' turn. Boring jobs, yes, but jobs. How are we going to eat, survive and perhaps consume if there are no jobs? Will fixed life income be distributed among the population as greater and greater proportions are displaced and become unemployed and unemployable? A distopia in the making.",

				"commentBody": "It was my understanding that the very thing that distinguishes a persons guilt for murder from manslaughter is: malice, timing and intent. 1. Malice: in this case,in my humble opinion, The malice could be presented that the police officer took it upon himself to express his anger that a man (regardless of race) had the audacity to defy his orders and maybe had even fought with him. I am in no way excusing that this altercation very well could have happened, and if it did it was non-compliant and wrong on the case of Mr. Scott but, it did not warrant him being shot eight times in the back as punishment. 2. Timing: did the officer have ample time to challenge his irrational thoughts of killing Mr. Scott as a punishment for his disobedience while he was clearly running away? In my humble opinion, a resounding yes. The officer had ample enough time with each step that his so called \" clear and present danger\" was steadily and surely moving in a direction away from him. If a normal everyday citizen like you an I would ever be involved in a fight where our opponent clearly has given up and decides to run and you or I take it upon ourselves to pull out a gun and shoot that person in the back we will be convicted of murder if the jury in our case follows the rule of law in determining there verdict. 3. intent: In my humble opinion, intent can be proved by a trained public servant swore in to protect and served chooses to not shoot a man 8 times in the back not to stop but to kill.",

You take every inconsistency as an indication of cold-blooded murder.  But a juror has to give him the benefit of the doubt.  You're a good prosecutor of Slager.  But you'd be a biased juror.  You probably dislike police officers, as many do.
