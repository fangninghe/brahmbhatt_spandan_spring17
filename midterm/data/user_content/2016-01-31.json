				"commentBody": "In listening to the NPR story on Friday where Iowan Republicans at theRepublican caucus were interviewed as to who they support.  The responses of these people remind me of Lewis Carroll's 'Through The Looking Glass', where the Red Queen proudly proclaims \"I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast\" without ever realizing the degree of ignorance, naivety, and gullibility required of such a feat.  What's a Republican candidate to do in order to gain their votes if not to pander to such a poorly educated bunch of rubes?  These people seriously thought that to elect a democratic president automatically meant their guns were going to be taken from them.  No question about it.  ",

Yes, my grandmother DID cook this way, and died or heart disease and was obese.  That's one family tradition I can do without.<br/><br/>But I attend a pulmonary rehab program with huge fans of Cracker Barrel (yes they ARE all overweight!).  They love the kitsch and totally buy into the \"we're just plain folks\" schtick.  And they love that country cooking.  <br/><br/>I don't see Cracker Barrel as \"southern\" - far more as \"country\".  And there are those who think if it's country, it's wholesome and good.  Maybe yes, maybe no, but that kind of food is good for NO ONE.",

But the cultural reality level of Cracker Barrel is worse than McDonald's. Besides that both of them are terribly responsible for the disappearance of the great Amazon Rain Forest and our global protective ozone layer, their food is killing people. Check the ingredients on their five gallon drums of \"gravy\". It's a long paragraph of eight syllable words from a college chemistry class.<br/><br/>But most of all it's the consciousness level that's the heart-stopper. Not just the kitschy worthless junk for sale, but the Disneyesque wistful illusion of the old South and sweet days gone by. Not so sweet for the great grand children of the slaves that were refused service by the great grand children of the slave owners. ",

With a head full of dreadlocks, I get my share of stares in some Cracker Barrels and Waffle Houses, but I'm always treated kindly, with respect, and humor by staff.  On a two week drive, I can gain 5 pounds eating in these establishments.  But I do this only once per year, so it's easy to shed the weight the following months.

				"commentBody": "We really need a two words. The ancient meaning of \"honor\" as reflected in these societies, the Koran, and the Old Testament was pride and power; the man is king and warrior and cannot have his rule questioned. It was not that long ago that a nobleman in royal England or France wouldn't have instantly imprisoned or slain a subject or woman in his domain who disobeyed. Women were once property everywhere. Our modern meaning or honor meaning self sacrifice and self restrain and protection of the weak is completely foreign to this old world. The whole developing world is at war with itself as modern honor strives to replace the old concepts. Meanwhile we are not doing a very good job of embodying modern honor when we torture, invade, and imprison while supporting despots and tyrants ourselves. Over a million people have died and 7 million displaced from Bush's war. Bin Laden could not have done nearly as much to create Al'Queda and ISIS as our own conduct has.",

Mostly, all our former foes tell us that we should count our blessings and that America was the luckiest nation in the world to be both  equidistant from too much of Europe and Asia and, to have had the best leaders and legislators for a time from FDR until Gen. Eisenhower. We ought to get another leader like Mr Roosevelt,(Either one  of them), and we'd do fine.<br/>Sorry, but God refused to put his oar in this one.",

But the establishment of a religion was rather quickly dropped.  Although Pennsylvania was one of the last colonies to be settled, it grew very quickly with the influx of European immigrants seeking William Penn's religious freedom.  Virginia's statute of religious freedom pre-dated the Constitution.  Inserting a wall, so to speak, between church and state was considered a very important part of the Bill of Rights.  Jefferson, Washington, Adams, Madison, Hamilton were not particularly religious.  The modern GOP. the Evangelicals, and the Catholics (yes, the Catholic Church and its continued fight against women's medical care), on the other hand, all want all of us to follow their particular brand of beliefs  -- really, a completely un-American concept.  Which, very unfortunately, seems to be becoming an American concept.  Jefferson, Madison, William Penn, et al, are certainly turning over in their graves.",

These trees were 300 years old when they died 500 years ago, as the shifting red dunes blocked off their access to water. Since then, the air is too dry for them to rot, so they stand. Wind and age have removed all the twigs and small branches, so they stand as humanlike twisted trunks, looking like they have bodies and arms. Their dancerlike poses are what makes them so compelling in photographs. Plus the starkness of the deep blue sky, and the thousand-foot red dunes that can be made to fill the horizon. Add the chalky flat desert floor, and you have some stunning colors. It is a photographer's paradise, because you can endlessly blend different ratios of white, red, blue, and the black silhouette trunks or their shadows, depending on your perspective and camera angle. The openness of the landscape lets you move about to compose the trees as any size or proportion of your frame that you wish. If Deadvlei were in the US, every photography class in the country would go there to teach perspective, framing, color theory, and composition.<br/>It is a stunning place, that I would put as one of the 7 wonders of the natural world.",

All of these (with the possible exception of Mozambique) are quite safe and filled with many natural marvels (certainly when compared with Johannesburg). A package combining stunning Cape Town, a safari, animal watching along the Durban coast with the cool mountains of Swaziland, the remoteness of Namibia, the delta in Botswana, and capping off with eating a freshly caught fish cooked on a grill for you on a beautiful Indian Ocean beach in Mozambique would be, for many, a trip of lifetime.
