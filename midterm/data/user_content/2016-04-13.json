Should he make less?<br/><br/>The reality is that the top and most popular players on both sides - Federer, Djokovic, Nadal, etc. - and Serena, Venus, Sharapova, etc., and the top players in their respective countries, especially when playing in or near home, bring in most of the fans and much of the revenue. So why not give that small group all the money and pay very little to some of my favorites, who are excellent but don't have a large following?<br/><br/>You can see that the situation is not nearly as simple as commenters here portray it.",

When the match was played, Navratilova was still ranked WTA No. 4 (behind Seles, Graf, Sabatini) and she reached the Wimbledon finals or semifinals in 1992, 1993 and 1994; reached the WTA Year-End Championships finals in 1992; as well as won 10 more singles titles since 1992. Connors was at the end of his career: ranked ATP No. 62 when the match was played; since 1991 he won only one more career match in any grand slam event; since 1989 he failed to reach the final of even small events.<br/><br/>If Serena competed against the top 500 men under the same rules, she would be lucky to win a match.",

				"commentBody": "As a provider my charges for individual procedures are set relatively high as a starting point with insurance contract negotiation.  My goal is to not \"leave money on the table\" with one of my 20+ insurance contracts.  Hospitals do the same thing.  As a patient I receive various provider bills and insurance EOBs (Explanation of Benefits) that list the original charge, the allowed charge after the contractual discount which can be substantial, the amount paid by my insurance, and my remaining payment.  In my mind the best benefit of insurance is that they negotiate a steep discount with my providers, sometimes more than 50%, to be in their network.  The only people that pay the full list price are those without insurance buffering the cost.  Again as a provider, I can provide my list price for a specific service but the amount I will receive and my patient will pay out of pocket depends on which one of my 20+ insurance discount contracts they have. They can all be different.  This fact that list price is often the opening gambit in an insurance negotiation explains some of the large variation, even 10X, for a given service or procedure in a given market.  <br/><br/>With increasing price transparency of late, this inflated charge master approach to insurance contracting is being replaced by more reasonable and competitive pricing that providers actually expect to be paid.  For now, a high list price may not mean much including better quality.  ",

Instead of a united party rallying for Ryan as a viable contender against Hillary- Trump and Cruz supporters are thumbing their noses in disgust at the thought of a brokered convention.
