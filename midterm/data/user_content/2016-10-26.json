That simply pushes such people into worse outcomes and eventually, into expensive ERs, hospitals or nursing homes. It has the OPPOSITE effect of what you hope to achieve.",

				"commentBody": "Maybe I missed it, but I see no mention of what happened when G.W. Bush was president...  Basically Bush told Putin that Russia was a threat to which Putin replied that he thought that America was the greatest threat to peace on the planet.  Putin made some remarks along the lines of America, without restraint, meddling in world affairs and leaving disaster in it's wake.  He also alluded to modernizing the Russian military to combat this potential threat (U.S.A.).  As far as I can see, this is just what has happened.  To that end, I'm not at all surprised at what Russia is doing today.<br/><br/>As an American, I have to agree with Putin.  These actions taken by the U.S. government were beyond the needs of protecting the people of this nation.  They were acts of pure aggression.  It's time for America to rethink it's political aspirations and start working with the other nations instead of following it's present path.  The reality is that the world is much worse off than it was before the middle east became embroiled in conflict.  <br/><br/>I don't need to say it, but if Russia is pushed too far, the gloves come off.  I think it would be safe to say that the U.S.A. would act the same way if attacked by Russia.  I can't say that I know much about politics, but I do know when the situation is serious, and it's very serious.  Not that my words matter, but just what issue is so important to these politicians that they would risk killing almost everyone on the planet?",

I'm just here to share my personal experience:<br/><br/>I did college before and after the military.  It was a lot easier post-military.  I had the GI Bill, free health-care (this matters!) and, most importantly, I knew exactly what I wanted from my education.  If I'd skipped my first 4 years of school and gone straight into the military, I'd have saved myself a lot of money and time.  The networking I did in the military has also been useful in civilian life.  For people who already want to serve their country, it's a great option.  That said, some of the most miserable people I met were soldiers who were just in it for the benefits -- don't do that!  As Nate said, it's a commitment and one you have to decide is right for you.",

An elephant should not be incarcerated either. <br/><br/>It has been only recently (last year) that American circuses (Ringling Bros.) have bowed to pressure and announced they would not incarcerate elephants and use them for trained stunts. I think they are now in open spaces with other elephants. (Or is that wishful thinking?)<br/><br/>I once read about an elephant who used to be 'parked' facing a wall in a stall when it wasn't being used for something, I forget what. One day another elephant was brought in to the same barn. The first elephant looked at her and began trumpeting loudly. It turned out the second elephant had been a friend 30 years before, and they were now reunited!",

							"commentBody": "Ringling's elephants have been taken to an elephant sanctuary that they have run for decades. They are Asian elephants (you can't train African elephants which is probably why they are going extinct).Asian elephants, like horses, oxen, camels, donkeys, all 'beasts of burden', have been bred &amp; trained for certain activities. In the wild Asian elephants do activities very similar to what humans ask them to do. There are cruel humans who mistreat all animals &amp; other humans. It doesn't mean that the animals should be sequestered.I knew a lady who was a good friend of themembers of Ringlings back in the 40's and 50's. She wrote a book about them. One of her friends was named Ruth. The girls who rode the elephants and did other sort of trained things in the circus were hired by the year. One year one of the girls and Ruth became good friends. When the music started for the opening parade (in which these 'show girls' rode in on the elephants) Ruth would leave her tent, go to 'her' girls and get her, at first it was only when the ground was muddy, then either muddy or it was wet, then every show. They did this all year, then the girl left, Ruth went to Sarasota for the winter. The next year everyone expected Ruth to go to that tent to get her friend, who had not rejoined the circus. She never did. Oh, Ruth was never led into the big top, she always took herself to the entrance, got in her place and waited for the announcement. Oh, Ruth was an elephant. When retired, she grieved.",

While eating dog meat is considered beyond the pale in  a lot of cultures, many countries have no problem eating horses. Japan, Korea and countries of the Steppes enjoy horse meat, and as do many Europeans countries. Horse meat eating is culturally taboo in most Latin American countries, but they have no problem slaughtering and exporting horse meat for consumtion to Europe. USA, Britain and Australia slaughter and export horse meat to other countries. Even though eating horse meat in these countries are not common, it's not illegal; our great neighbours- the Canadiens love horsemeat. Also, No, China hasn't single-handedly killed off the elephant population-  a lot of Africans, Europeans, and Americans play a big part in the elephant slaughter for ivory. All this is not to say, what is being done to that poor polar bear is atrocious. It is. I personally consider most zoos and \"wildlife theme parks\" as cruel and unnecessary places.",
