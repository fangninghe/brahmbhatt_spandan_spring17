				"commentBody": "This is long overdue. Public housing tenants have been suffering horribly from second hand smoke and have been requesting smoke free policies for many years.<br/><br/>Landlords have a right to prohibit smoking in their rental housing and many,  if not most, do. Smoke free is the norm these days for housing, hotel rooms workplaces and all indoor public places. Smoke free public housing is consistent with these norms. <br/><br/>Possession of cannnabis is already illegal in all federally subsidized public housing and will remain so. When cannabis is legalized in a state it's usually subject to the same restrictions as tobacco. Posssession is legal but smoking is restricted.",

				"commentBody": "I hope that the ban works, but it's going to be hard to enforce. While a lot of those who smoke say that they know it's not good for them, virtually none of them actually understand that the smoke is poisonous for everyone exposed and that the risks of contracting the worst of diseases reflects how many have done so, already. Of every one hundred people who smoke, thirty three will die of respiratory, cardio vascular, or cancer diseases, the only question is which ones. Every smoker doubles their chances of dying due to one of these diseases, every one of them. But what I see everyday are many people of all ages smoking, obviously in the belief that they probably will not suffer because of doing so. ",

I suffer from asthma and to deal with other people who choose to voluntarily poison their lungs and poison the lungs of their fellow human beings, it's just disgusting. We can leave cars, alone, they're a mode of transportation and are vital, but smoking is not essential. Even in my apartment I have to fear that the other tenants are smoking in the halls at night.

Thy are sure to be so righteous, like religious fervor.<br/>The assertion that smoke from one apartment seeps into another is ridiculous. I happen to be an engineer and can refute it in court anytime.<br/>Let's be honest, this is class warfare.

So one smoker's exhaling can be smelled upstairs despite concrete floors since the walls are not insulated and the vents are not checked if they are even working..

It stands to reason that the experience of having to quit brings the same kinds of physical responses to everyone. The difference in how one person manages to overcome the initial withdrawal symptoms and to refrain from starting to smoke again until the cravings diminish to zero, seems to be where the differences are to be found. I quit a very heavy habit long ago. It was a big challenge but it did not involve the suffering that alcoholics and drug addicts experience when they try to quit cold turkey. The challenge was not with the symptoms from the withdraw nor with the strength of the cravings but with the ease of resuming the habit and of knowing that temporarily quitting was never difficult -- it was with willingly never having any desire to ever smoke, again.

Cigarettes were big business and media collected $$$ promoting different brands and encouraging new users.<br/><br/>We know the costs now, but smokers didn't set out to become addicted or to endanger others.  Those I know try to restrict their smoking to their vehicle, or to a particular room.  (Most city folk don't have vehicles, so that leaves only the second option.)  They're doing the best they can with an addiction and a habit of consumption that was actively promoted.<br/><br/>We should discourage smoking by all reasonable means.

Biggest reason why elders who smoke stop smoking in their unit  --  new articles about an elder burning to death while smoking in bed.   Same reason why some elderly residetns are so harsh on their peers -- not wanting to be put out on the street from a fire.<br/><br/>Elderly poor do not so much care about second hand smoke as they care about not becoming homeless;  Odd thing that; people who live in low income housing are afraid of having no housing.",

However, many children living in public housing suffer from asthma and other respiratory problems. It is prudent to make non-smoking the norm inside buildings. It will make it healthier for everyone.<br/>Unfortunately, it is impossible to keep illegal drugs out of the buildings let alone a deadly legal one. Without actually throwing people out in the street, along with their innocent children, there is no punishment that can work. I don't see how this can be enforced when welfare recipients complain about not having enough money but manage to always have enough to buy cigarettes. Cutting off benefits only harms the kids. I'm sure someone would bring a lawsuit if those in public housing were forced to enter a smoking cessation program to be allowed to keep their benefits. It's worth a try.",
