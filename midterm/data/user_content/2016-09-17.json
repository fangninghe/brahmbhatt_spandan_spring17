				"commentBody": "The cable networks endlessly showed an empty podium as their commentators salivated, and finally The Great Trumpolini spoke.  <br/><br/>A grateful Barack Obama finally settled into his office knowing that the Ultimate Authority on Everything had accepted his citizenship and thus confirmed his Presidency as legitimate.<br/><br/>Trump may not understand this yet, but the embrace in which he and the media lovingly exploited each other is about to destroy his candidacy.  He renounced birtherism for the best of reasons - taking it off the debates table (if that even works).<br/><br/>But I believe that for once, and when it matters most, his (or rather, his handlers') media instincts let him down and left the Emperor with no clothes.  Trump says he has \"ended it\", but he hasn't.  By casting aside birtherism in just a few words but in a blaze of publicity, he has reminded people how offensive he has been over the years, and exposed how casually he can treat the truth. <br/><br/>I would never rule out Hillary's campaign snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, but they are probably heaving a huge sigh of relief right now.  Trump's faithful, no doubt, will stay with him, but I can't imagine how others stand by someone so unstable, deceitful and, yes, deplorable.  ",

No sugar, no dairy, no alcohol, no grains. Oh well, I thought, that's too extreme for me, but my brother-in-law was motivated to make some big changes in his eating patterns, because his father is diabetic and has lost both lower legs to the disease.<br/><br/>I've never been a dieter, but as a measure of solidarity with their program, I decided to cut back on sugar intake. I haven't gone cold turkey, I still take a tsp of sugar in my morning coffee. But I'm not eating ice cream and baked sweets, and instead of granola (too sweet) with my morning fruit, I'm eating a handful of almonds instead. Interesting -- in 4 weeks I've lost 6 pounds, and it wasn't much effort.<br/><br/>I'm starting to think this sugar business is pretty insidious. And the best way to fight back is at the micro level, by not buying what they're selling. I'm glad to read that soda sales are declining and seltzer water sales are rising. Little by little, the truth is coming out.",

				"commentBody": "\"Their plea for scientific objectivity may have sounded sensible, but it masked nefarious aims.\"<br/><br/>It took more than 50 years for JAMA to expose the chicanery employed by the sugar giants.  Let's hope it doesn't take  the JAMA as long to expose big biotech's manipulation of the EPA, FDA \u2014 and itself!  <br/><br/>Crops genetically engineered to generate their own poisonous insecticide \u2014 Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) \u2014 and immunity to another poison \u2014 glyphosate \u2014 have so far had a free-ride through regulatory agencies specifically designed to protect the public interest.  <br/><br/>To boost an industry emerging in the 1980's, the FDA and EPA chose to rely almost entirely on safety studies that were conducted on rats and for only for a small duration of their full life cycle.  To date there have been zero epidemiological or clinical studies done in the USA on human beings regarding the possible harmful effects of two poisons: glyphosate, a probable carcinogen, and Bt.  <br/><br/>No cohort studies either and with the July passage of the aptly dubbed DARK Act, serious scientific examination of GE foods' effects on humans has been deterred once again.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the FDA recently found US honey has residue levels of glyphosate double the limit allowed in the EU.  <br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/fda-finds-monsantos-weed_b_12008680.html\" title=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/fda-finds-monsantos-weed_b_12008680.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carey-gillam/fda-finds-monsantos-weed_b_12...</a><br/><br/>The JAMA has exposed big sugar's deceptiveness.  Time now for it to re-examine GE foods, an industry much closer to home.  <br/><br/>Time for an integrity check, JAMA.",
