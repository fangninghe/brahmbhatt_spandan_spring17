				"commentBody": "The last time I saw Paris...<br/>We had some 40 rooms at a hotel for three nights; I was trying to save some difficulty at the airport by shipping our music home in cartons. I went to the desk to inquire where we might find a business center to assist with the shipping process. Just as I began to ask, the phone rang. I indicated that the manager should please go ahead and answer the phone, I would be happy to wait, but she said, \"I insist, let me know what you need.\" Taking her at her word, I began to ask for help. Only after I had begun to speak did she pick up the phone and answer the call.<br/>That is the very definition of my verb \"to be Parised.\" It has nothing to do with attitude or language as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Provence is very very nice.",

				"commentBody": "The ultimate issue is whether we are intelligent enough to survive. That is, have we evolved to a point where we can successfully cope with climate change. Based on many of the comments, we may be on the path to extinction. Even though China has joined with the United States in signing the Paris climate accord, that still allows for a continued rise in global temperature of about 2 C that allows the worst effects of sea level rise and superstorms to occur. So, even our best efforts, opposed by Flat Earth Republicans, may be too late. Hopefully, The Donald will scrap the wall and work with China to build an ark.",

I have been worrying about the impact of global warming on our food supply and flooding due to rising sea levels &amp; extreme weather  but after reading this piece, it occurs to me that the various causes theorized for \"secular stagnation\", the very slow economic growth condition, that thus far has cost the Gross World Product trillions of dollars in lost economic growth.  I would add warming to the causal factors, which include; demography, education, inequality, globalization, energy, that have reduced the rate or innovation &amp; seems to have slowed labor productivity.<br/><br/>Please discuss with Paul Krugman because I think you are on to something.  That is why it is incredible that GOP candidates deny global warming because typically they are the party of economic growth.  To deny the evidence that the planet is warming &amp; a principal cause is the saturation of the atmosphere with fossil fuel emissions that are increasing much faster than Earth's natural sinks, is just plain hard headed stupidity.  <br/><br/>My colleague, Dr. James Powell, his son Dr. Jesse Powell, an oceanographer, and I have completed a new book, \"Silent Earth\" to describe how to stop using fossil fuels for energy by creating very cheap electricity in space &amp; beaming it to Earth, using a portion of the electricity to make liquid hydrocarbons with air &amp; water, and build 300 mph superconducting Maglev logistics networks.",

The US and Europe could enact strict environmental laws, but if China, India, and other industrialized nations don't also have strict laws, it won't make much difference.  Even more companies would move dirty factories overseas.  They would still pollute - just not in the US.  They would combine their pollution with the factories that are already there, and global warming would continue.<br/>.<br/>And I'm not done.  There's also the question of what to do with all those abandoned factories in the US.  People don't talk about it, but a failed local economy is awful for the environment.  Bankrupt businesses and towns can't afford to clean up Brownfields.<br/>.<br/>So yes, we need to act.  But the US can't go it alone.  Global warming can only be fought at the global level.

I graduated from college almost 40 years ago.  It's not the material I was taught that I remember.  It's how to ask questions, how to look up information, how to start again, and how to work as a team that has stayed with me.  And we were not encouraged to work in teams for learning or studying.  In the work world no one cares about that A you got on your calculus final.  They care about how professional you are.  They care about trust in you, your dependability, and if you can do the job.  <br/><br/>Knowledge matters.  So does being able to get along with your fellow workers.  Professors who can teach us subject matter and about working in teams will better equip students to work in today's world where no one can have a monopoly on knowledge because there's so much to know.",

Michael Levine, a 25-year veteran of the DEA, has done much to publicize how this \"War\" is guaranteed to go on, demonstrating that the CIA has gone after some traffickers while protecting and even profiting from others; the real events portrayed in the film \"Kill the Messenger\" similarly show how the CIA has profited from the Drug Trade; Robert Mazur's memoir \"The Infiltrator\" demonstrates how US banks continue to profit from laundering drug money.  We Americans are all addicts; if we are not addicted to drugs, we are addicted to the jobs provided in arresting and imprisoning users, the jobs in banking in laundering drug money, and the jobs in military and law enforcement whose ostensible objective is stopping the Drug Trade.

Or, better, they simply do not make it back to the police station alive.  This may seem un-democratic or out of line for today's legal norms, but unless the sanction is so heavy, the drug business will continue...and the US will continue to be a country \"addicted\".<br/><br/>The recent horrific sights of two persons passed out due to heroin injectiona with their child in the back seat bring forth the dynamics of the heroin addition now spreading nearly everywhere in the US.  As people attempt to \"stop their habit\" through medical/social interaction, ten more become addicted.<br/><br/>Again, very harsh sentences must be demand by the public..those who trade in drugs must pay a heavy price.<br/><br/>I know what your might be saying..we've tried that and the prison are full of drug sellers.  How many options do we really have...those who sell drugs in quantities now within the metrics of DEA must pay the price, regardless.<br/><br/>Drug and sustenance abuse in the US is truly out of control.
