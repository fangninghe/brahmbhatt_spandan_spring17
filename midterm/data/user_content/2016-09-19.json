				"commentBody": "You did in fact confuse income and inflation. Social Security is raised based on a basket of goods. Some have gone up, most have stagnated or gone down. Energy, food, travel, electronics have all not increased.<br/>It might feel to you differently, and it may even be truly different in your area.<br/>That does not change the fact that nationaly inflation is actively too low. And while social security is a difficult issue that should be addresses, current lackluster rises have nothing to do with what you wrote.<br/><br/>Additionally, you are welcome to read detailed description of all the methodology used by the Bureau of Statistics.<br/>Once you have, let us know if you find mistakes. Until then, your conspiracy theories are just that.<br/><br/>This remarkable recovery (when compared to other countries or the great depression) has produced a striking list of positive indicators. Job growths, investment figures, nascent industries.. and now rising wages. If you think about it, fallowing a gigantic wave of unemployment(with many workers) it takes time to get to a point where enough are hired again to create a competition for workers - increasing wages.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you refuse to believe data when it doesn't suite your predisposed opinion, don't use it when it does. For example, don't state the last few years were bad, bases on the same parameters you are no questioning. That's just hypocritical.",
