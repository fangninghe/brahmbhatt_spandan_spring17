				"commentBody": "Although Clinton is an excellent debater, there are important problems with her candidacy which are not noticed, specifically facts about her record with Bill and her presentation style.<br/>1.    In talking about relatively poor people she comes off as a missionary i.e. she wants to do things for them, i.e. are attitudes are tinged with a whiff of superior condescension.   Sanders talks about rights people have not met under the current system.   I rather think my rights abrogated than receiving alms from a rich patron.<br/>2.     The Sanders campaign has not been pointed enough about the record of the Clinton administration:  Its support of NAFTA/TPP is only starting to be mentioned.   The repeal of Glass-Steagall i.e. Gramm-Leach-Bliley was signed by Bill with Bernie voting in opposition, this merger of commercial/intestment banking facilitated by the Fed (which acted illegally to extend the powers of Commercial Banks) .   Hilary badly needs to be polled about this specifically did she support one major cause of the 2008 meltown and does she support a new version which will disallow the Fed giving permission to Commercial Banks?  Which of the large banks does she want to break up if any?  Why?  <br/><br/>Demonstrating she took large monies from the big banks are one thing but showing that she supports policies favored by large Banking Interests is much more effective in showing that she is largely a candidate of Wall Street.",

				"commentBody": "Trump is not so much stoking fascism as he is humiliating us in the eyes of the world. Pick a country, say Latvia.  The Latvians would not elect this man to a city council anywhere in the country. <br/><br/>Problem is, this might turn into a bait and switch. The Donald is not capable of running this country, but his main opponent, Ted Cruz, wants to shut down government altogether, and leave it starved for cash for every mission except oil subsidies and bombing.  Oh, and Jesus Christ will be whispering advice to him every step of the way.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bernie is about to topple the Queen. The end result is likely to be Sanders/Trump. The Republican bench is composed entirely of people who will say and do anything for money, especially if it comes from the oil, ag, or armaments industries. Trump might be crazy, but his opponents pull off a miracle, and manage to be even worse.<br/><br/>A 60/40 Bernie spanking of The Donald is playing out now.  If Bernie wins, the CIA and Air Force will have to learn to take orders from him. The only presidents who have done that since the CIA was founded are Kennedy and Ike.   If Bernie loses, or dies mysteriously, I will become very worried for our democracy. ",

				"commentBody": "Because of modern communications, the guys in the Fleet will be able to see this.  In my day there were about 10 movies that circulated in the Pacific.  Our luck was to show \"The Phantom Stagecoach\" 100s of times.  On my ship, we reached a point where the sound was killed and the dozen officers on the ship could recite the lines without the sound.  \"Hotshots\" would have been a great comic relief from the repetitive story of an armor plated stage coach that was used in the western robbery scenes.  <br/><br/>A lot of moviemakers got their start in making movies about WWII.  I see where Mr. Spielberg will be Harvard's commencement speaker.<br/><br/>Two years of \"The Phantom Stagecoach\" at sea turned me into a compulsive reader and a rare movie goer.  I saw \"Brooklyn\" in 2015 and really liked it but that beautiful movie did not receive an Academy award, so I probably have lost all feeling for the moving image as the result of the immunity acquired in the Navy.  I did not see a movie in Vietnam but I did get a lot of reading in anthropological studies of the people and the history of how we got involved in that quagmire.<br/><br/>I hope this will help you understand why I am a little tough on HRC's vote to invade Iraq and my distrust of political geniuses who believe a show of force makes \"political\" sense for re-election.<br/><br/>I am high on preserving h.sapiens and making the whole World a better place.",

Rather than fine people would didn't buy insurance, they could have set a rule that if you didn't buy insurance when it was available, you had a surcharge added of 1% for every month of delay. <br/><br/>The reason it wasn't set up that way is because there is a huge disparity between the costs of different groups.  The premiums for the young would be tiny [no taxpayer subsidy] and the premiums for the old would be huge [huge taxpayer subsidy].  In order to hide the total cost, they decided to triple the premiums for the young (and unisex them) to make young working men subsidize contraceptive and maternity care for young women.  And they decided to triple the premiums for the young in order to reduce the taxpayer subsidies for the old.  They hid the total cost by forcing the young to subsidize the older and richer cohorts.",

The reform was implemented reasonably there, i.e., with resources provided to each school, no high stakes testing in advance of availability of adequate resources, no RTTT arm-twisting. New York was the opposite, and many other states had subsets of the problems New York experienced. The biggest issue -- whether the reform is implemented thoughtfully or not -- is that there is no evidence that the CC or similar reforms reforms are worth their substantial bankroll (and yes, the federal government did support the reform, e.g., by underwriting the $360+ million cost of CC aligned tests). Achievement trends and gaps have not been shifted by these reforms (NAEP scores are largely down this year, though that's just one data point). One justification may be how much money is shifted toward various chunks of the education market place, e.g., technology companies, publishers, testing companies, and a swath of think tanks whose funding bends them, directly or (somewhat) subliminally, toward supporting the reform.",
