I had hoped that Serena would have been in the final, but I have to say that Kerber and Plishkova gave us an amazing match--6-4, 4-6, 6-4--one break in each set. Exciting stuff. Football just doesn't do it. (And none of the players came out with a concussion--my son got five of them playing football in high school!)",

The fans new the match was over and yet Novak was allowed to rest for a long time to get his strength back. This is wrong. When a player is beaten they must forfeit or the umpire must default the player who refuses to play. Marathon runners do not get to stop the clock when they are tired or injured. Basketball, baseball, and football players don't get to stop the game. Boxers are disqualified if they are too injured to continue. Tennis is no different. The ATP and the USTASHI need to fix this before the sport loses integrity. Those long rest breaks helped Novak get back into the match. Stan lost some momentum during those breaks. It wasn't right.",

Tennis is not like the other sports you mention....stopping play to treat injuries is a way to enable the player to return to the match, for the match to have a proper outcome and for the spectators to get their time and money's worth.  There are no substitutes or even other teammates to carry the load as in other sports you mention and much of the world sees fighting sports as cruel and unwatchable...boxing is not a model for other sports to follow.  And tennis rules do not allow players to seek treatment for being tired as you think they do. <br/><br/>Before you compare tennis to all these other sports, think about how you would feel if you had traveled hundreds or thousands of miles and spent hundreds or thousands of dollars for seat at a tournament in Spain or America or England or Italy....and a set or so into the match, the referee ends the match as you want, because the referee perceives the player is a malingerer.   <br/><br/>Its a well-recognized aspect of tennis that players must maintain the highest standards of their own mental and physical fitness and be able to withstand the antics of their opponents, the noise and comments from spectators and questionable calls by officials.....plus wind and heat.  You have to stay fully \"in the zone\" for the entire match even if all those things are conspiring against you....apparently Stan was able to do that.",

I thought we were treated to extraordinary tennis, although I must say, in that first set, the commentators had Pliskova beaten by the fourth game! I found that they did that to many of the players--one might get down by a couple of games, and the commentators would dismiss the player, only to watch that player come back. (What WAS LZ Grandson's expertise in tennis, anyway?) Neither one of those women in that final lost, in my opinion; both were winners. Such exciting tennis. That's why I love it. That's why I continue to play it. Thanks so much to Kerber and Pliskova! ",
