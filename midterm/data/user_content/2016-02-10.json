It\u2019s a shame this didn\u2019t happen decades ago.\"  People did realize this decades ago and started drug courts, the first one in the US started in 1989. There are now drug courts in all 50 states -- 2,734 drug courts in the US who serve over 136,000 people per year. Drug courts vary across the country but the goal is to steer individuals with non violent drug and drug-driven offenses into drug treatment as an alternative to incarceration to increase the likelihood of successful recovery through judicially supervised treatment.  While participants are not monitored throughout their lives by the court, these courts get people into treatment and incentivize them to stay in treatment instead of going to jail.

				"commentBody": "Wow! Nice work, Frank, as usual, but this column in particular is quite an elegant frontal assault on homophobia. Only the truly brain-dead, I think, could fail to be persuaded by this truth.<br/>In the immortal words of Rodney King, \"Can't we all just get along?\" That sounds good to me. All of us: straight, gay, black, white, and all permutations in between and out on the fringes. If we're not all alike as peas in a pod, we are nonetheless all of us just human beans, trying to get along. In a truly civilized world, that would be a piece of cake. The Golden Rule would suffice, law-wise. But alas, I'm afraid that is never to be.<br/>For I strongly suspect that, way back at the dawning, rogue Neanderthals got to our human women. It has been known for some time that, contrary to beliefs popular during the early part of the 20th century, interbreeding did indeed take place. My working theory is that this bit of ancient miscegenation produced hybrid creatures which, given they were only half-humans corrupted by an earlier, failed bipedal model on its way to extinction, tended to be crude and insufferable. I believe the genetic inheritors of these traits, in present times, tend to vote Republican.",

In fact, Clinton has outshined Sanders in every single debates. Do you actually watch any at all?<br/><br/>No, the issue at hand is not about the lack of debates or vigor on the Dem front. Younger voters want a fresh face (even if Sanders is nowhere near a \"fresh\" face at all in the Washington circuit, given that he's even a committee chairman himself), to these voters' mind, as old as Sanders is, he's fresher-looking at Clinton, and that's all that matters to me. Whatever their angst is toward the Dem establishment (aka Obama who fails miserably in translating his \"Hope\" and \"Change\" campaign promise, whatever that means), and Clinton pays the price for that, if only for just sticking around for far too long, first with her husband, and then with Obama's administration.<br/><br/>You should be truthful to yourself. If you want to support Sanders just to spite HC or the Dem establishment, go for it, but make such lame excuse like HC has achieved nothing, or there's no debates, or she doesn't have a message. Whatever message there might be from the HC camp, I doubt if they would be good enough for these young angry voters anyways.",

Regardless of her claims of innocence, neither people nor corporations give something for nothing. <br/><br/>I will give $5 to Bernie Sanders' campaign for the second time because I believe he'll work for me and millions other who pitch in on average $27<br/><br/>Goldman's Sachs will give Hillary $5 million because they believe she'll work for it and a few other big Wall Street firms. It's called pay for play. <br/><br/>And her argument that Obama accepted from Wall Street firms and still passed Dodd Frank act (which Wall Street still tries to chip away from) only proves my point. Since I am sure Wall Street much preferred that loophole-filled legislation than being surrounded by an angry mob with the pitchforks! So all Obama did was to diffuse the situation for the bankers, and nobody went to jail. <br/><br/>And that's because if you take big money, be you White or Black, Man or Woman, Democrat or Republican you'll feel consciously or subconsciously obliged to the person or group that gave you that money. <br/><br/>Reciprocity is part of human nature, and there's no sense denying it. The only foolproof way to not give unwarranted favors to rich and powerful is not to accept anything from them in the first place!",

Only when counsel turned to leave did I even notice that all three participants (judge and counsel) were female , something I saw simply because both counsel were visibly pregnant.<br/>That's where we are as a society: focused on the income and wealth divisions, less concerned with gender divisions.

Please consider these intemperate hyperboles. Or take your place in line with Albright and Steinem in the desperation cohort.<br/><br/>My tepid support of Clinton is based on two pragmatisms, hard-won and bitterly swallowed: electability and governance. My heart is often with Bernie, and in a world where all is quickly achievable would cast my vote with him. But his simplistic and bombastic harangues have little chance of persuading undecideds and despairing Republicans to vote Democratic, and display poor strategy and tactics. (For example, \"free college\" when it should be means-tested full grants does not have the required nuance to gain passage and be affordable, and the pitched health care reforms are very poorly packaged. The message is everything in politics.) My opinion at this point is that with Sanders, we risk Trump or Cruz a bit more than with Clinton.<br/><br/>Though I'm increasingly of a mind that experience in the DC snake-swamp is more of the problem than the solution, I don't have the confidence that Sen. Sanders has the foreign policy chops to deal with the likes of Putin, Assad, Bibi, et al. Do I have full confidence in Clinton in this regard? No. Do I think Lloyd Blankfein will have a hotline to the Oval Office? Possibly. Would meaningful financial reform occur under Clinton? No.  <br/><br/>But there we are. In the muck.",

All logic would seem to support that conclusion -- but experientially, I've increasingly been struck (and as a man) that it proved easier for an African-American male to become president than an establishment white woman. Plenty could be said about flaws in Hillary's career ... but I have observed enough iceberg-deep, even unconscious prejudice from men towards talented women that I've been forced to conclude that women -- over half the human race -- are the most systematically discriminated-against group in the world. Young women who feel feminism has achieved victory and we can all think about something else should take note. In many respects the world is in a backlash as far as women's rights go, not a progressive phase. To elect our first female president in this climate would speak volumes. That said, I certainly agree with Frank that gender, race, sexuality, etc cannot be the only criteria. Competence -- ideally excellence -- trumps all. But who is more competent to navigate our country through remarkably treacherous world waters -- Hillary or Bernie? And who could win a national election? A semi- self-proclaimed socialist? Perhaps in 100 years -- but in 2016, that would be more a miracle than electing a woman! Political progress is a grinding ground game. Relying on the Hail Mary pass isn't a sustainable strategy for progressive politics.",

He needed  to have a big enough enemy and create enough fear in the \"threat to the American way\" in hopes people would see him as the only viable solutions to this deep, dark ever present threat, instead of rationally looking at him and what he had done.<br/><br/>Stop it.

				"commentBody": "Its a practical matter. From an interview Bernie gave last summer, <br/><br/>\"Sanders explained that when he was making his decision to run for president in 2016, he considered doing it as an Independent because he feels the Democratic Party is \u201ctoo conservative, too cozied up with big money and corporate America.\u201d But ultimately he decided that the \u201conly way\u201d to run for president \u201cat this unique moment in history\u201d would be to do it as part of the two-party system.<br/><br/>\u201cIf it happens that I do not win that process, would I run outside of the system? No, I made the promise that I would not and I will keep that promise,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd the reason for that is I do not want to be responsible for electing some right-wing Republican to be president of the United States.\u201d",
