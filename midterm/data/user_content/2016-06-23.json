				"commentBody": "Fantastic article and expos\u00e9. What struck me the most about this project is the relative lack of input from the other world powers. It's hard to overstate the strategic value of the Panama canal. One would think that countries like the US and China would have intervened once rumors about shoddy construction and questionable design choices began to surface. <br/><br/>Furthermore, at $3 billion, this project is relatively cheap compared to other mega-construction projects. For comparison, Seattle is currently considering a $50 billion expansion of its light rail system. So, even with small assistance/buy-in from other countries, the Panama canal authority could have easily covered the cost of a well-thought out and executed project. With the stakes as high as they are, I'm surprised that this option was not pursued.",

They have poured more concrete in the past fifteen years than the United States has in the past century, BUT it is such a low grade (wrong aggregates, too much water, and not enough cement) that it won't hold up as required.  Their steel isn't of a good quality either.  I do industrial/commercial concrete design for a living, having started out as a carpenter/finisher.  Now thirty plus years and a college degree, I can truthfully say I know concrete.  I take pride in what I do, but I am afraid this is not a project that is going to end well.  A billion dollars?  That is a lot of Portland Cement, rebar and experienced workers to make sure it all comes together for a good finished project.  This sounds more like something Jimmy Hoffa would have had a hand in.",

							"commentBody": "\"Where will the Americans bomb if we bomb their proxies?\" asked the Russian general of his Tsar. ... You know, Mark, frankly (you know, Frank, markly), I'm getting tired of seeing the word 'neocon.'<br/><br/>Almost all of what you said is a red herring. You're inflating the willingness of Putin to defend Assad rather than Russian interests; the two are not indistinguishable. We've already seen Putin hint at cutting him adrift. And recall, if you will, the Russian reaction to the potential strikes after Ghouta. That reaction was in the form of a plea, not a threat. And no one wants to take the Russians' Tartus base away or start a war with them. Heaven forbid we strong-arm the Russians. However, America has allies all around the world. Putin has said he'd have to be crazy to go to war with NATO. If Putin knew that America was going to proceed militarily, he'd change his calculus; I'm sure of it.<br/><br/>A thug is shielding a mass murderer and you've got no problem with it. The diplomats are right. It's past time the United States led an international coalition to end this conflict. But you're correct about Hillary Clinton. When she takes office, she probably will use force to expedite an end to this god-awful war, which will probably still be raging. When she does, you'll be howling 'Iraq!' or 'World War 3!' You'll be wrong, but an admittance of that fact I won't long be waiting for.",

							"commentBody": "There seems to be a lot of confusion over the way the article read vs. the stars conferred, but it actually matches my experience. In fact, despite agreeing qualitatively, I think one star is kind. It suggests that although the restaurant's food actually isn't very good, he hates to speak ill of it because it was so charming and well intentioned.<br/><br/>To wit, when he says that on some nights the schnitzel \"doesn't crunch as emphatically as you want it to\", he's basically romanticizing the fact that the wiener schnitzel is often clumsily and poorly executed. In no way should that be praiseworthy, but he is charmed enough to rationalize it as part of trying to seem like a longer-tenured restaurant. In my experience, the schnitzel was just mediocre and sloppy. A huge gaffe at a restaurant that is playing at being traditional Austrian. And even worse in light of all the infinitely better schnitzels available in town, such as the ones at Seasonal and Edi &amp; The Wolf. Wells was kind not to trash it. <br/><br/>Similarly, he wrote about the about the spaetzle in the goulash, but doesn't actually praise the goulash itself. It's as if he's trying to avoid mentioning that the meat was embarrassingly poorly butchered. Every bite contained connective tissue, unpleasantly jiggly bits, or stuff you'd want trimmed off in a version costing $30. Wells wanted to like the place more than he did, but their actual food is sub par, and if you're going to try to produce nostalgia, that requires better execution.",

Trade is great, but the size of ships and the colossal growth of this industry reflects the inequality of our trade. With virtually everything made NOT IN AMERICA, all these imports are dependent on travel through the canal. It's all part of the oligarchy and the squeeze on working people. The shipping industry is not what it used to be. It is a virtual pipeline to everything we now own and don't make her, unfortunately. ",

Coventional tugs could be used on the conventionally sized ships.<br/>Now getting the 'water mules' re-positioned for the next cargo ship after clearing the lock would slow things down, probably more than what is now required to re-position the conventional tugs now used.<br/>The faulty construction of the locks is going to be a real tough one to fix.

The original canal was built by the U.S. government, supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers.  They got the job done, and well.  Now that major public works projects are contracted out to corporations looking to make profit at the public's expense, these sorts of scandals happen all the time.  Bechtel, portrayed as the \"responsible\" bidder here, was at fault for many of Boston's \"Big Dig\" tunnel problems - a woman was killed when part of the tunnel collapsed on her car in 2006 and Bechtel was fined hundreds of millions of dollars for their negligence.   Or look at the cracking on the $6 billion+ San Francisco / Oakland bridge replacement.  Corporations put their profits first and this is the result.",
