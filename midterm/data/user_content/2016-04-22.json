Large companies don't open their doors for a tax credit either, but they take advantage of every credit available to them.  In fact, they get to write off so much that companies never ever pay taxes, we all know that.  So it's left to me and other working class people to ask for more, because that's exactly what the business community does all day, every day.  We bail out banks, auto companies, and Wall Street, yet people question a higher education? How unAmerican.",

I just point to something relatively recent:  his campaign sent a letter to the DNC complaining that they think, with no proof, that the Hillary Victory fund is violating election law.  Then they sent an email to their supporters claiming that as fact.  <br/><br/>Now, if they were really concerned or had any evidence, they should go to the Federal Election Commission.  Instead, it was a media/bullying tactic, intended only to become a press release and to raise money on.  <br/><br/>That looks like fraud to me.<br/><br/>And, the irony -- the campaign that the FEC is looking into for potential fundraising violations?  The Sanders campaign.",

				"commentBody": "Neither candidate has a path to the nomination without the superdelegates, and the reason the party in its \"wisdom\" chose to have superdelegates was so they could nominate the most electable candidate. That certainly is not Clinton if the GOP choses Kasich, and probably not Clinton if Trump cleans up his act as he is promising to do. But Sanders comfortably beats them both.<br/><br/>You wrote very contradictory positions about when to capitulate: \"It's time to pull the party together and prepare for the General. Hillary conceded with class and threw considerable influence behind Obama in '08 once the primaries were over.\"<br/><br/>Your words are \"once the primaries were over\" - well they are not over until June 15th, so, following Hillary's example, the time to think about what to do next would come then, not two months earlier. Btw, I would not have called her concession speech as doing it \"with class\", and I believe it was done with a deal, was it not? A deal that has put the torch to the Middle East.",
