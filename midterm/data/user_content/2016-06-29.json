				"commentBody": "I heard Senator Sanders speak in Albany, NY this past Friday. This was the second time I've heard him speak, the first being at a massive rally at UMass, Amherst in February.<br/><br/>What impresses me about the senator is that he genuinely cares about people who have been left out of the political, economic, and social system and his campaign policy positions reflect that concern. This is the same concern that he expresses here.<br/><br/>Millions of people, and especially children, cannot be relegated to second-class citizenship because of forces often beyond their control.  Just as the New Deal and Great Society attempted to address the needs of people, the political system needs to even the so-called playing field so that the basic needs of housing, healthcare, education, and freedom from want are central in this political and economic system once again.",

Your fiduciary responsibility to your shareholders can only be maintained by not misleading your customers and fraudulently skirting regulations.  Those regulations are in place to protect your customers and the public at large.  <br/><br/>This scandal was born of short term profits.  It costs many, many millions to develop a new engine.  No question about that.  Those new engines will in turn be used in millions of cars.  The scope and scale of this malfeasance is mind boggling.  And for what?<br/><br/>The engine could not meet specs.  Its production should have been stopped and the problems worked out.  That delay would also no doubt have cost many millions, perhaps many tens of millions or even much more.  But they tried to pull a sneaky and got caught.  Now they are on the hook for over $15 billion and that is just in America.<br/><br/>Remember the BP oil spill?  That occurred because the bore was not completely filled with concrete.  Only three plugs were poured in order to save money.  How much was saved? $1 million?  BP ended up spending tens of billions for mess. <br/><br/>Some people just can't learn from the mistakes of others.  Volkswagen is now some people.  Think about this the next time a corporate titian claims success in business is a qualification to hold high office.  (Success often means I didn't get caught).         ",

				"commentBody": "The world\u2019s economy is in such a bad shape that even the best minds in mainstream economics fail to give any clue to the politicians. Politicians of course love to speak on the subject because the urgent economical problem is what matters the most to everybody. With respect to the issue, a common-sense view is helpful, i.e. to vote for a wanna-be-billionaire like Hillary Clinton is not that much useful as a ready-made one like Donald Trump by reason of his bravura faith on the future of capital. <br/><br/>Globalization of capital has long been a herald of manna from heaven for the rich to raise their bottom lines. It may have also been some crumbs studded under the table for the gainfully employed middle class to scrounge around. It has not been so kind to the unemployed and underemployed or the working poor. Capital is defiantly doubling down on whoever wants to question globalization as people suddenly wake up to the gravity of the situation of the trade issue to which they have faced up. <br/><br/>Whoever wins the presidency will lead us nowhere economically so long as the system remains unchanged as the rootedness of the problem lies in the system of economy that strands in contradiction between socialized production and private expropriation of its means of production. Donald Trump might shock and awe the system to such a degree that it would start to rift a little. Only being reeling from entrenched problems of systemic failure, it would be able to repair its mistakes and reborn.",

It is the reality that goods can be made where it's cheapest to make them and sold wherever people want the goods for purchase.<br/>Do you only buy goods made in the US. If not, you are participating in the global economy. Do you want to pay 45% more for goods made in China and sold at your Walmart or Home Depot? Well that's the tariff rate Trump wants to slap on Chinese goods. And no president can change the movement of goods world wide.  No Congress can change this. The only people who could change this sit on American company  boards of directors. And they can't change it much. ",
