Dance for twelve hours straight with two of the best dancers ever to perform on film, when you weren't even trained as a dancer? And smile all the way? Who could do that? Possibly just one person.<br/><br/>She was the last of the big stars from Hollywood's Golden Age, I think. The end of an era.",

My main takeaway is Kerry's acknowledgement that the solution must be brought about only by agreement between the two sides.\"  That solution has failed for nearly fifty years--has Steven Roth ever heard Einstein's definition of insanity--doing the same thing over and over and hoping for a different result?  After these decades, we should realize that only an imposed settlement--an offer neither side can refuse--will resolve the conflict.  The international community that imposes the settlement will face some hefty bills: compensation various losers--disposed settlers (they have to go home again) and Palestinian refugees (they can't go home again) for example.  And the international community would have to keep the two sides from getting at each others' throats for a few generations.",

If the Palestinian owners of land in the occupied territories refuse to sell it, then the land should be left vacant. <br/><br/>We should not forget that America in the world is an \"owner\" that benefits from property rights and their recognition under international law.

He talks about Hamas, and about the way 98% (or whatever) of the land does not necessarily permit the minimum amount of autonomy that an independent state needs.
