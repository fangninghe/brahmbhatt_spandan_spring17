				"commentBody": "Exactly, Jerry.  What happened?<br/><br/>I agree that he was right that the banks should have been nationalized regardless of the perceived laws.<br/><br/>What has happened ever since has been pretty inexplicable.  Emotion?  I suspect some of it is that.  Krugman doesn't make friends easily.  Does he have any besides his wife?<br/><br/>I don't.  Analysis can only go so far.  Eventually, politics is about shared goals and friendship.<br/><br/>Some people are not good at that.  Some feel a kinship without friendship.  This is probably advisable to influential people.  Friendship gets in the way of analysis.<br/><br/>But what is better, kinship or friendship?  It depends upon the need of the individual and the situation.<br/><br/>Some of the worst despots originated due to a lack of friendship.  At the same time, some of the worst friendships originated out of the lack of good analysis.  But in most cases, good analysis combined with friendship and kinship are better.  The world is a mess, and good feelings are fleeting.<br/><br/>Everything else follows our feelings.",

				"commentBody": "Every reader--every reader--should read in detail Bob Woodward's interview with Trump in the Wash Post. Also listen to the video of Woodward giving his reaction.  It is absolutely incredible in every conceivable way, most of them favorable.   He all but announced Kasich as his VP to serve almost as co-President.   Hillary is in the deepest of trouble in the general election, the very deepest of trouble.<br/><br/>But of more immediate importance, he did something that no major political figure, let alone a presumptive major party nominee has ever done.   He said flatly that the market is way too high and that no one should buy stocks.  One might even guess that might lead to an interesting week on Wall Street.  <br/><br/>The Woodward interview shows that Trump is very deep and thoughtful, if not very informed.   (The argument that we are the verge of a really major recession and that he will end the national debt in eight years is, some may think, slightly contradictory and should produce some response from Krugman.)    It is clear, however, that he knows his comments may cause a crash and that he doesn't care if he is blamed. He is probably right on the political judgment .   A very interesting man and Kasich as co-President will keep him under some control",

Only the democrat who runs on Obama's achievements can win this cycle. Doing otherwise is simply suicide. That is the reason Sanders is playing a very denerous game. The essence of Sanders revolution (yet to materialize) requires him to run against both Obama and Republicans. Otherwise why change all the status quo now? If the economy is as good as it is now, or even better in November, how will his message sound?<br/><br/>Why not make a much easier message of evolutionary change by building on Obama's achievements? The message is simple, things are improving, and we will make it even better.<br/><br/>My guess is that if ",

I recommend the militant Sanders supporters start acting like true progressives and do anything they can to prevent any of the Republican options from getting to the White House.

A major event, a earth shaking event can truly change things. Trump has offered himself up as a strong man, and events have a way of happening that call for strong men.

This is certainly history in the making. I've never seen anything like this. It's an eye-opener. We are still dealing with Americans who refuse to admit that the Confederacy lost the war. We should never have pulled out Federal Troops from the defeated South.<br/><br/>Trump could have been quashed years ago of the GOP demanded an end to Trumps crusade to convince people that Obama was born in Kenya and was therefore NOT President. Instead they played their cute little games.<br/><br/>America will survive. The GOP won't.",

Most of the active military personnel are from the South. Northeastern folks make up a much smaller component than members from the Western states. We had a higher number of ROTC program members at our colleges and universities.<br/>Eleven military bases are named for Confederate military officers and today's military could almost be said to be the Confederate Army.",
