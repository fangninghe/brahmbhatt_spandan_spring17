				"commentBody": ".<br/>Updike is my favorite novelist; he describes everyone and everything right down to the last detail. But if your guy had been in the armed forces, he may have hung out with a corpsman in a little shop of carnivorous plants. By this point in his career, he can attend any big awards ceremony and it won't be his first RODEO. Considering who his mother was, there is a very specific Faye Dunaway - John Huston plot twist that is most alarming. (preveal mostly over)<br/><br/>Speaking of well-known people, Garry Shandling will be studied in future generations as a writer. Of course, delivery was a big part of his act, as it was for Jack Benny; but the writing often sparkles. (preveal totally over)<br/><br/>And we who love words should mourn the loss of Earl Hamner, Jr. who -- in the interests of brevity -- wrote \"The Waltons\". The character based on him was \"John-Boy Walton\". The actor who played John-Boy can now be seen on The Greatest Show On Basic Cable, \"The Americans\" (starring Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell). Not watching it is like not watching The Waltons.<br/><br/>Neither Hamner nor the actor has a Chicago Connection. But oddly, the actor -- much like former Chief Justice Warren Burger -- has \"Earl\" as his middle name.<br/><br/>Good night, John-Boy.",

							"commentBody": "That's a nice thought but inaccurate. In 2015, the U.S. supplied 31 percent of the world's weapons exports. Russia was not far behind, with 27 percent. If the U.S. stopped its weapons exports, Russia would ramp up its production and distribution to reap the profits. China, Germany and France accounted for 5 percent each last year - they very likely would do the same. <br/><br/>I question the objectivity of people who want to blame the U.S. for every problem on the planet. Could we do better? Yes. Are we the devil in what otherwise would be a Garden of Eden. No. <br/><br/>I'm a liberal Democrat who opposed the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. This country has a lot to answer for. But we are not the be-all and end-all when it comes to peace and prosperity in this world. That kind of thinking is not only inaccurate - it's downright hubris, and it's dangerous. It's the self-hating liberal version of conservative jug-heads chanting \"USA! USA! USA!\" at mass gatherings. ",

				"commentBody": "This situation is exactly why I scrutinize and question law enforcement activity. In contemporary America, being arbitrarily arrested and/or detained for a few hours or even days may not seem like a big deal but as far as I'm concerned it is a big deal, for it is a perversion of the fundamental organizing principle of society - the exchange of natural rights for legal rights. And for what? Not being sufficiently deferential to the authority of law enforcement officers a/k/a \"contempt of cop\"? Does anyone even know or care where cops get their authority and power from and for what purpose it exists? Do you think the existence of individuals with power and authority over other individuals is \"just the way it is\" or a natural state of affairs? Given the universal recognition that all men are created equal, the answer is no, it is not. I am not anti-law enforcement. I just know that the authority of law enforcement is granted as part of a sacred agreement between the state and individuals, and its abuse, therefore, is nothing short of sacrilege, and must be diligently watched for and opposed. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_arrest_and_detention\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_arrest_and_detention\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_arrest_and_detention</a><br/><br/><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_cop\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_cop\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_cop</a>",

				"commentBody": "Acts Considered Resisting Arrest<br/><br/>Resisting arrest is usually defined as intentionally preventing a police officer from lawfully arresting or handcuffing you or taking you to jail. Here are some things that can be considered resisting arrest:<br/>\u2022Physical acts, such as running away, hiding, or struggling with the officer<br/>\u2022Giving false identification, either verbally or by presenting a fake ID<br/>\u2022Trying to help another person avoid arrest<br/>\u2022Threatening the officer<br/><br/>Being slow to comply with an order or swearing at an officer is not, by itself, usually enough to warrant resisting arrest charges. Neither is questioning an officer's actions or authority before ultimately complying with requests.<br/><br/>Defenses Against Resisting Arrest Charges<br/><br/>The key to defending yourself against resisting arrest charges is to remember that such charges hinge on you resisting an officer of the law in the lawful execution of his or her duties. Here are some possible defenses, depending on your situation:<br/>\u2022Unlawful Arrest: If the arrest was not lawful to begin with, you did not do anything wrong even if you did resist. The officer was not performing his or her duties, since there is no duty to make an unlawful arrest. An example of this is resisting during an unlawful search of your home.",

NYPD police seem to behave as if  they have forgotten their role as public servants, first and foremost.

The Times sadly seems incapable of reporting the self-evident character of these serial outrages.

At it's core this is about police that think they can do whatever they want and nothing will happen.  That they are above the law themselves.   This has got to stop.  Police used to be seen as part of the community, as public servants.  Sure they always arrested those who were committing real crimes, but they weren't harassing the public or policing for profit.  We, the public, pay their salaries.  Just take a look at the case of Adrian Schoolcraft - this is coming from the top.  The rotten elements need to be excised from these departments so the police who joined to make their communities better can get on with their jobs.",

The GOP is returning to the 1700s when it comes to beliefs about sexual activities, and who does what to whom. <br/><br/>On top of that the attractiveness of these women takes place ahead of what they could contribute to the president.  So these refugees from the neolithic call for policies that the followers of superstition and ancient beliefs formulated from ignorance and fear of the world about them. How putrid can they get with these attacks on each other wives? This is the ultimate in sleaze, just what we need for a president. Makes me wonder which foreign female leader would come under their attack if they cold not work with them. <br/><br/>And yet they will get a substantial number of votes for engaging in such disgusting behavior. They reflect a particular segment of society, that people with manners and decency do not associate with. <br/><br/>Wotan help us all if one of these troglodytes should get elected.",
