				"commentBody": "The main reason to vote for Sanders is to discipline the Democratic party into actually supporting liberal policy proposals, instead of ignoring its voters and continuing to support pro-business and moderately conservative policies. I'm not sure how that aim is diminished if Sander's healthcare proposal isn't ready to be adopted on the first day of his presidency. If incrementalism is the right way forward, why isn't Hillary Clinton laying out incremental steps toward single-payer healthcare or some comparable arrangement?<br/><br/>That said, I think a candidate like Sanders is rightly criticizable if, as is charged, his policy really does rely on magic asterisks and is deflects attention from its actual implications. But even if that is all true, he's facing opponents who are more than wiling to do the same thing. It's one thing to say that politicians shouldn't fudge numbers in proposals to voters. It's another thing to say that my favored candidate shouldn't fudge numbers in their proposals, given that all of the other candidates fudge on their major proposals and never seem to suffer significant setbacks in their candidacy for doing so. Perhaps Americans should be persuaded that not all ineffective treatments should be part of the health system. But perhaps it's asking a lot to say that a candidate should be the one persuade them shortly before the first primary.",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>.<br/>Yesterday, my friend Martin received a few recos for saying he doesn't understand half the things typed here by JFC and me. My friend Leapfinger, forgetting her delight 3 years ago when I unearthed from her girlhood an advert for a great place to get smoked FISH in Montreal, suggested that Martin raise that half to 75%.<br/><br/>JFC took umbrage at the recos, and elegantly explained one of his Comments, leaving me to flop AROUND on the deck.<br/><br/>So I have unreccomended the offending Martin Reply, shifting the reco to JFC's self-defense. For myself, I have no explanation, but I do agree that Martin understands everything. Sometimes, he understands what we are going to type before we type it, because he sees the grids in advance.<br/><br/>That is all folderol. What is important is this: The French word that appears at the end of even non-French films is FIN. It is widely understood to mean \"the end.\" But of course, FIN is the English word for a defining body part of a FISH. <br/><br/>Why has no one mentioned that the brilliant Mr. Walden constructed his FISH puzzle so that the answer to the very last clue is - in a bilingual pun - FIN?",

I wish you and your colleagues would look at this question, closely.  I feel like it is the heart of this next election.  Incomes and wealth continue to concentrate both in the US and globally.  My mentor on this issue was Mancur Olson who published a good study in 1982 which said that as the rich gained a larger slice of the pie, the total size of he pie shrank. see. The Rise and Decline of Nations 1982.  If Olson was right, and I think he was ,it seems to me that that is the issue for the 2016 election.  The land fares ill in a representative democracy, where tax havens are legal and our own tax code is favorable to capital gains and high income earners on payroll taxes for FICA.  The drift to oligarchy is clear, Donald Trump says that he could buy Congress, and we seem to also be drifting to monopoly at a swift rate.",

				"commentBody": "Alright, but at what point if you are dealing with a group of people from the same background that is different from your country and who have a different world view, do you say \"we have a problem.\"  If 1 of 1,000 is violent, it is an aberration, how about 50 / 1,000? or 100 / 1,000? or 250 / 1000?  Where is the line were a country can legitimately there is a problem with this group?  And if there is a problem, are they justified in subjecting that group to - increased scrutiny, or higher entrance requirements, or domestic surveillance, or out right banning of that group?  Where is the line and what are appropriate responses?<br/><br/>These are no longer theoretical questions to be debated by philosophers in obscure journals.  These are real world problems that European countries are grappling with.  We should be watching how they handle this, because our turn is next.     ",

Yes, I am adding this recipe, as it is that special and unique.  The Rosemary/ garlic flavors, and the warmth of black peppery heat, were all present.  But the texture and moistness of buttermilk infused meat was transcendent. I marinated for 2 days, and am never going back! I may try using the equivalent of all dark meat next time, in the form of thighs..maybe a wing too.",

				"commentBody": "Waffling?  How is the moral imperative to recognize the suffering of others and offer them hospitality as a mark of human solidarity waffling.  All the political backbiting and grandstanding is waffling. <br/><br/>And 10,000 refugees is \"expensive\"? .004% of the American population?  We have taken in almost a million refugees since 9/11, I don't recall any banks being broken. Can you point to any fiscal hardships? On the contrary, while Europe struggles to make a 2.2 fertility rate to maintain population, the U.S. easily absorbs and assimilates hard working refugees who join the society and contribute to the general welfare and bail out the rest of us paying for the Baby Boom in retirement.<br/><br/>How do you know how much resettlement costs? Not too much.  Much of this work is outsourced to groups like Catholic Charities and furniture, etc. is largely donated. The government resttlement period is six months and most charities do not help more than three or four months. I helped some families get settled through Catholic Charities, and the refugees I met were eager to jump in to American society, start working and start building their lives.  Many of them have family support or support among their ethnic group.  And the government gives each refugee less than a grand to get settled.<br/><br/>The bottom line: refugees are forced to flee. And like the essay notes, we as human beings have a duty to welcome them.  They give back far more than \"we\" put in for them. <br/><br/>\"Waffling\"? I haven't seen it.",
