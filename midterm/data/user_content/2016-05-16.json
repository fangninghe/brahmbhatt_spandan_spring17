I wish I could have spent an evening in some tavern with him sipping bourbon. He died too young and too tragically. <br/><br/>Obviously you forgot my post when I related my father taking care of me. I'm thinking of putting MTF and you in a playpen.  All that's missing would be the diapers.",

As the peasant army occupied the capitol, the Ming government invited their vassal the Manchurians inside the Great Wall to help crush the rebellion.

Perhaps the whole point of the Mereen thing is to get ships and learn the difference between waging war and ruling a city.<br/>Nice parallel between sisters (Yara Greyjoy, Sansa) reuniting with brothers and reminding them of what's at stake.<br/>If I remember correctly, the wildlings were an army of 10,000 a few seasons back and now they're at 2000, maybe. Winterfell is a tough castle to take even with fair numbers. The army from the Vale (creepy Lord Robin's) had better get there in time.<br/>Great episode but bring back Bronn please!",

Clearly, in this rural California community that votes Republican consistently and, for a voter who favors Donald J.

How they became wealthy and why - the connection between much of American wealth, how it was accumulated and continues to be amassed - just don't figure into this equation. There is no awareness of a connection between American capitalism's reliance on a system of classes and racial sub-classes in order to function and, therefore, it just isn't a part of her awareness or millions of Americans like her, regardless of social or educational attainment.

Our next president, whoever it will be, will need to lead - not follow Congress - on a living wage, free childcare, healthcare coverage for all, and free college. <br/><br/>A living wage is the first family value we need to redress.<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.rimaregas.com/2016/05/on-the-fightfor15-realdonaldtrump-is-nipping-hillaryclintons-heels-blog42/\" title=\"http://www.rimaregas.com/2016/05/on-the-fightfor15-realdonaldtrump-is-nipping-hillaryclintons-heels-blog42/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.rimaregas.com/2016/05/on-the-fightfor15-realdonaldtrump-is-ni...</a>",
