Apparently Piazzolla was taught to play Bach on his bandoneon when he was 12 by Bela Wilda, who had himself been a student of Rachmaninoff.",

				"commentBody": "Good call.  No reason to have to put up with this nonsense.  With almost 325 million Americans and growing, there are going to be some haters and tribalists but no doubt what you experienced on Twitter is not representative of the feelings of the vast majority.  It is even more liberating to give up Facebook as well.  And kudos to the NY Times for not requiring mandatory social media participation as part of the modern employment environment (or for comments, as some media outlets do).  It is a strange time in America and social media has not necessarily been a net positive.  As to the merits of Mr. Kagan's argument itself, I do think it would have been stronger coming from someone like Rabbi Lerner of Tikkun rather than a  neo-con interventionist.   ",

Big data for the big sell.  Twitter gathers, analyzes and packages its data stream generated by free content from dupes who use it and sells to corporations who further slide and dice data to spot opportunities, identify potential markets, design messages or ads, drive marketing campaigns, measure cost-efficiency, plan product inventory and distribution, even project staffing needs.   <br/><br/>In the hands of social scientists and political operatives, Twitter data yields powerful political intelligence and facilitates targeting of customized content to specific groups.<br/><br/>Twitter is a powerful tool for developing and advancing hidden agenda that serve special interests often in conflict with public interest or democratic values of accountability and transparency.<br/><br/>As for Twitter's tolerance of anti-Semitic users, its second largest shareholder is billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Alsaud.  A related NYTimes article today reports how Saudi Arabia threatened to defund key UN humanitarian efforts for children if Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon didn't remove Saudi-backed militias from a UN report on war crimes against children, which was promptly done.<br/><br/>Benign appearance. Malignant intention. It's a corporate and political trap.  Victims eagerly jump in. <br/><br/>It's America of, for and by twits. ",

Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal is one of the biggest voices for liberalization of Saudi society and is considered highly suspect by the nation's religious elite. Prince Alwaleed employs many women in his organization and insists that they are free to dress entirely as they choose while at work. He also advocates for the Saudi recognition of Israel and supports a 2 state solution.<br/><br/>It is a common mistake to paint ALL Saudis with the same broad brush. This is nothing but another form of prejudice. We must keep our minds clear and our eyes open, so that when someone like Prince Alwaleed comes along, someone we can work with to make the world a better place, we can hold up our end.",
