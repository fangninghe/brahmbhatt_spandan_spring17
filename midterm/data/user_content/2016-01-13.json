				"commentBody": "Wages are down over the last three decades because \"free trade\" has been given priority over everything except corporate profits.<br/>The increase in the national debt was caused by a dishonest war paid for with a dishonest budget (costing 45,000 dead or wounded service people), massive tax cuts for the super rich, including capital gains (resulting in 20% unused capital) and a Great Recession (at the end of about 8 years of almost complete Republic control of government) that wiped out all of the jobs created over 10 years.<br/>I don't like Obama because he is too conservative. He put Goldman Sacs back in charge of the treasury. He is for the Trans Pacific Partnership, which will give global corporations more veto power over our democracy, and he does things like record prosecutions of whistle blowers.<br/>But he is right when he tells the People that it is Our Responsibility to, more than vote, speak out, organize, and Pressure The Government to fix the political system so that it represents the People. This is the only real important issue until we can take back democracy from mass corporate media.",
