It is but a collection of parts-- legs, boobs, a uterus. <br/><br/>The Republican Party was totally comfortable with Its standard bearer's open contempt for people of color, the disabled, and veterans. But demeaning the ultimate symbol of Virtue, white womanhood on a pedestal in need of protection, they said no more.<br/><br/>America, search thyself. I hear people offended for their daughters and granddaughters, which doesn't go far enough. Be offended for all citizens, all humans. That which is disgusting, repugnant, repellent, all relevant thesaurus entries, should be rejected outright on moral grounds.<br/><br/>That said, I feel bad for Melania and the 10 year old kid. Some things, money just can't buy.",

				"commentBody": "Men can be vulgar, and none of this comes as a surprise.  If Trump had adopted an elegant tone when it comes to addressing the Fairer Sex, this might have been interesting.  A memory comes to mind of a woman, once a secretary in the Private Sector, the powerful men, sometimes dangerous.  'She's pretty but too thin', two men standing and speaking to each other out loud.  Perhaps she does not hear, or is a dumb beast.<br/><br/>Either way, she does not care.  Fast-forward to years later.  'Not in front of the lady', a construction worker to another, both Trump supporters.  She's heard it all and her years of blushing are over.  So we know that Trump sounds revolting, but it was Truman Capote who knocked my socks off when he wrote his 'Answered Prayers' and his true stories which destroyed him.  True, he was not running for the Presidency.<br/><br/>Trump is real.  He has been the most fantastic distraction for our Nation, and can he please take his hat and go home?  I want a President for my Country!  We have only a month left, and we are still going on about him and his antics.  Why so quiet all of a sudden here in \"Trump-Land\"?  Some people are worried about surviving the aftermath of this Recession.<br/><br/>Strong women and men on both sides of the political Country have been shouting that it is time to work.  Work for a better future for starters, and for those who are still agitated by old boy, Chump, they can read 'My Life and Loves' by Frank Harris, which may bore and put them to sleep.",

I wonder what Melania Trump is thinking right now--Trump publicly humiliated her by talking about trying to have sex with a married woman.  We should \"blame\" her for standing by her husband--the same logic Trump uses to attack Hilary Clinton.<br/>I don't know the old boys' club will end soon, because not just some men but also some women themselves support the patriarchal system, and they will still vote for Trump, sad, very sad indeed.",

				"commentBody": "Keep Trump as the Republican standard bearer! He represent what the majority of Republicans believe. Fox News, Koch bros, and the entire Republican establishment have created and promoted this vile populist cesspool. It needs to be held up for all to see. They need to be shamed to reform and/or die. For decades they supported the worst of human motivations. Now this is manifest with the pathology of Trump.<br/>The Republican Party's replacement needs to be tempered by the fire of humiliation and rebuilt with true secular virtue that supports all the citizens of our nation.",

The need to just ignore it all in order to keep the job and make a living. The Boys' Club is alive and well, but we're coming for you guys, we're coming for you. And guess who we have on board? Young adult women AND men who truly get how immoral and repulsive this behavior is. Seeing all the \"beautiful\" women surrounding Trump, with their perfect bodies, perfect hair, made-up faces, and high heels excusing his boorish misogynistic behavior makes me furious. Money is obviously still the first priority for those women.  ",

Saying that it has increased from an earlier time overlooks the fact that both men and women have degraded themselves thru some weird form of freedom and self expression...decorum is out the window, chivalry is sexist and musty. This is supposed to be social progress from repression.<br/><br/>You have to weep for the world we have left our kids to navigate. Presidents and oral sex with interns. Candidates and lewd talk. Hardly the stuff that I would have expected from Washington, Lincoln or FDR.  Sickening.",

You know the same passage you cite in Genesis describes woman as \"helper\" to man --- and uses the exact same word that is used to say that God is a \"helper\" to us.  It implies that the woman knows more, sees more, has power. And the word Adam means human, not male person. We are created in God's image male aand femaile according to the bible. Donald has to answer for himself, as do all men who behave this way. Lets put responsibility where it belongs.",
