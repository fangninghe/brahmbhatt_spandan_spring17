Young black males can contribute to this effort by not participating in the drug trade, not indulging in scary-looking gang type tattoos and no longer looking and acting like the thug-types that cops fear. On the other hand, police abuse of power in several well publicized incidents (the one in SC comes to mind), where broken tail lights are an excuse to stop and murder the black male drivers, has got to stop.  How about videotaping EVERY traffic stop as a standard police procedure, creating committees to review the tapes and including community members of color to review the recordings.  The power to pass on the criminality of police conduct against blacks must not rest exclusively in the hands of majority white reviewing bodies.
