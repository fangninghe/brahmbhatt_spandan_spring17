I take Sanders supporters at their word and do not believe they are interested in forming a circular firing squad, which is what they would be doing, if all the Recommends and signs and marchers were actually Bernie people and not Republican trolls drumming up support for their boy, Trump.<br/><br/>Sanders supporters have three choices: organize and vote for Clinton, spending the next four years working for better policies and candidates; help Trump by voting for Stein, Johnson, or no one and spend the next four years watching things go further down the toilet; or, they can live in a fantasy world.<br/><br/>Donald \"Let's Make A Deal\" Trump admires Putin and won't commit to NATO in the face of a possible Russian attack. Remember the deal the Republicans made with Iran to keep Reagan from losing to Carter. (Times; \"New Reports Say 1980 Reagan Campaign Tried to Delay Hostage Release\"; April 14, 1991.)

The NeverTrump people tried to force a delegate vote, and failed, very early on, and Ted Cruz snubbed Trump and didnt endorse him, committing political suicide in the process.<br/><br/>Aside from that, it was a pretty good show of a unified party, with unified goals.<br/><br/>Unlike the DNC so far, which only a day or so in, has the crowd divided between Clinton and Bernie supporters, and Sarah Silverman actually insulting them live on national TV, then saying \"we can edit it in post\".<br/><br/>The fact that there were chants of \"Bernie\" in the convention hall, and not Hillary, is hardly a good example.",
