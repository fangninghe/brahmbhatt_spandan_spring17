The most popular college team in New York City is Notre Dame, which happens to be in Indiana.  If fans don't care, they won't support a local team.  That is UConn's fate.  A premier program would exist if the fans cared.  And folks who think that makes northeasterners high-minded don't know what this is really about.  UConn has no football rivalries, it's got no history of success, and it exists in an area where three  prominent NFL teams are all well-supported.  The northeast is big football country, it just isn't college football country.",

Nebraska had already been kicked out of the AAU before the Big Ten offered membership to Rutgers, so that cannot be a deciding factor. What was a deciding factor was the fact that Rutgers is in the NYC media market and UCONN is not, allowing the Big Ten Network to negotiate capitation rates for including the channel in cable and dish packages in the greater NYC area. That's a lot harder argument to make with UCONN.",

Since then, only magic - and most of it basketball magic.  The football program is a joke.  Rentschler Field was built 25 miles from campus in East Hartford of all places - so depressing - so it wasn't for the students.  As with most things in childhood (and college is part of childhood), once the adults and boosters got involved, they have done their best to ruin the university experience.  Still UConn basketball is an amazing thing.  Rejoin the Big East and let the magic continue!  Go Huskies!",

				"commentBody": "The basis of your logic is not sound.  Rutgers made its way into the Big 10 with a historically weak football program.  The driving factor was access to a lucrative media market.  Connecticut offers very lucrative media market in terms of size and demographics.  Abandoning football would be nonsensical and would forfeit any chance for P5 entry and the economic benefits that follow.  UConn is not some sleepy old Yankee Conference school.  It is a top 20 national university, and it will find a spot in the Big 10 unless the Big 12 grabs it sooner.  The market is simply to attractive to ignore, and the school is academically superior.  The only question will be whether the Big 10 recognizes that by taking UConn they preemptively lock up the Northeast.  ",

It is a personal choice issue if one would like to use.<br/><br/>lou andrews; I don't like Clinton. Sanders I think is the most trustworthy but he won't win the primary. Trump there is a benefit if he does win office in that congress will hate him so much that both parties would unite to override vetoes. This could lead to some powers that were expanded under Bush and Obama to be taken away. This would a be a good thing to reign in executive orders that both parties have abused..it's a gamble but I'm willing to take that gamble. So yes I will be voting for Trump in the general; do I support any of his policies..absolutely not. I support open borders; no borders ideally and think immigrants are vital to any country with an aging population. But..at the time it would be nice to see presidential powers curtailed some, if anyone could get congress to unite to accomplish such..it would but Trump.<br/><br/>As for cheating; well as mentioned earlier in this reply I want transparency so we know who uses and who does not however we do not ban them.
