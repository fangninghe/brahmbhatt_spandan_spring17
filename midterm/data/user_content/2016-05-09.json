				"commentBody": "This is so sad.  The longer Afghanistan drags on, the more I think about Viet Nam.  Remember peace with honor?  After countless lives were lost while we implemented it, we ended up leaving without peace and without honor.  Viet Nam was lost not because of strategic errors, but policy errors.  That war could never be won.  We sacrificed over 58,000 American lives before we came to that realization.<br/><br/>Afghanistan is similar.  We are analyzing our strategy but no strategy will work.  The policy we are attempting to implement cannot be implemented.  So the conflict drags on.  Lives continue to be lost and Americans are being sent home in body bags once again.<br/><br/>The Taliban have no timetable.  They have no schedule.  They can continue indefinitely.  They are not an external invading force that can be driven out.  They are indigenous.  The constantly regenerate. <br/><br/>After all these years of combat, the reality is that no military solution is possible.  We can't save the Afghanistan people from themselves.  What is worse?  A totalitarian state run by religious fanatics, or never ending war that takes the lives of many thousands each year and makes life impossible for everyone.  <br/><br/>We have supported terrible tyrannical dictators over the decades because it suited our interests.  Why is the Taliban any worse?  Declare victory and let the locals sort it out.  We can't lose something that is already lost.                 ",

				"commentBody": "Healthcare mustn't be a commodity to be squeezed for profits (although that's what it is in the USA). Do Republicans really expect people to seek out the cheapest medical option? Do they do that themselves? If they have, say, heart problems, do they look for a low-priced medic, or do they try to find the best cardiologist possible? Most people who have health coverage also have a doctor they trust; are they really expected to check around for someone cheaper if they have a health problem? And how would they do that, exactly? I found it difficult just to find a dentist in a emergency, and paid a couple of thousand dollars for the repairs, but even if I had been able to call around and find out prices other dentists charged, I doubt that I'd have found anything cheaper--and even if I had, the procedure might well have been declared more complicated than expected, and the price would have gone up. The consumer simply can't control medical costs except by avoiding medical treatment, and that's what the theorists can't seem to understand.",

It all sounded so reasonable, and the cure was to return to the gold standard so the FED could not just keep in printing money like Germany did in the 1920s. <br/><br/>As the years rolled by, and wages increased, and my income did so also, these things never seemed to materialize. I read the neo classical economist, the Keynesians, and books on the market. Then Nixon allowed the value of gold to float, and yet no crash, no Armageddon. All the gloom and doom gravitated to the conservatives for simply political purposes, not for the benefit of the country as they would like you to think, but to reinforce their agenda, which is to shrink government. Even as our population grows, as demands on infrastructure grows, as income disparity rises, they continue to preach better times ahead by austerity. Despite historical evidence to the contrary. <br/><br/>Now their evasions, lies, misinformation is catching up, and they are paying the price. They will not give up easily, they will fight to the last to keep up their pretenses. They can not face reality, their little egos will not let them.",

Like Cersei and Jaime playing their big move of taking over the Small Council only to see them fail.  Like Arya being willing to drink from the well.

Not sure if he made the traitor woman \"happy\" or killed her via the \"leader-clad friend\" he mentioned, but he did get the information he wanted - yep, he's back!  The reanimated Jon Snow has not gotten any extra energy from this trip into the afterlife - still the same drooping around. Handing over the Lord Commander role seemed very perfunctory - his watch is certainly over!  Where's he going - Winterfell to fight with Ramsay? Knight's Landing to fight with Cersei/Jaime/Sparrows? People who have had near death experiences are often psychic on their return - will Jon now have visions to rival Bran's?  It is strange to have so many of Ned Stark's children in desperate peril - Jon came back from the dead but is still a marked man, Arya got her sight back but still has no freedom, Sansa is on the run and has one friend (Brienne) to protect her, Rickon is now entrapped by Ramsay - and may soon be missing important parts of himself, if Ramsay goes the Reek route. The Tyrion game segment fell really flat - but the Small Council meeting was very funny. Great to see Diana Rigg back as the sharp-tongued relative of Margery, reminding Cersei that she is not the queen, and that the Lannister family tree is very twisted, indeed. Uncle Kevan is dead in the books, murdered by children, but in the show, he's alive and kicking Cersei in the shins. We missed the dragons! And where is Littlefinger??",

I feel like Jon Snow's storyline needs the comic relief that Sam provides. <br/><br/>Also, pretty awkward in Mereen.
