I did not like the drone strikes either but am not convinced Hillary would have continued them.<br/>Re: \"Who are Clinton's friends?......\" I disagree that she was/is only comfortable among the wealthy.  I know people who have met her and to a person they describe her as a warm person who LISTENS.  Like you, I don't like that a long time ago she sat on the Wal Mart board.  Maybe one of the reasons was she was from Arkansas; at one time Sam Walton's stores were filled with products made in the USA.  I dislike what Wal Mart is today, personally do not shop there.  But, I despise what Trump represents and the people like Carl Icahn he associates with.<br/>Re: \"Finally, I suspect that Hillary could not have passed let alone funded her infrastructure improvement plan for the same reason that Obama couldn't.\"  Strongly disagree on this one.  Hillary made friends on both sides of the aisle as a Senator.  She was on record as saying that one of the first things she would do was sit down with members of Congress and drink with them.  She was well liked in the Senate and knows how to work the system better than Obama.<br/>The better woman and candidate lost and I am sad about it.   ",

				"commentBody": "It seems as if America was more connected during the periods when nationalism and protectionism was more emphasized.  A town like Newton, Iowa, (population 15,000 today) had a good number of washing machine manufacturers in the early 1900s.  At its peak, Maytag employed 3000 there.  But, in 2007 the plant closed.  Globalization took away some of the contribution that rural towns were making to the fabric of society, and at the same time reducing the choices and income available there. So, would you not expect \"widening political divergence\" and alienation?",

				"commentBody": "I think the main reason that Hillary was defeated was due to the fact that she was a Clinton, not that she was a woman.  I'm sure that being a woman was an issue for part of the electorate, but she had built up a multi-decade record that people did not trust.  They did not trust that she had the best interests of the country in mind, they did not trust that she would represent them, they did not trust that she understood and sympathized with the common person.  In a way this is a backhanded complement, she was judged on her record and found wanting.  It therefore cost her the election.<br/><br/>There will be a woman in the White House when she is the strongest candidate, when she shows through actions, not just words, that she represents all Americans, that she believes in service, and has a clear vision where she wants to take the nation.  I think after 4 years, perhaps less, of Trump, there will be an opportunity for someone with civility, a vision and an attitude of Servant Leadership to win the White House.  It could be a woman if she started preparing now, but expecting it because she is a women, is a losing ticket as Hillary has shown.  It will have to be because she is the best person for the job. ",

She wasn't, not even close, but she sure got people believing it.<br/><br/>Sanders was a mayor for 10 years, then in the House for 16 years, then the Senate for 10, all before running for president for a total of 36 years in elected office. He had won 14 elections, and lost 5 (all but 1 very early on in his political career). He was, in short, the very definition of an experienced and seasoned politician.<br/><br/>Clinton's resume is quite a bit shorter: She was a senator for 8 years, and Secretary of State for 4. She's won 2 elections, and now lost 2. She likes to confuse the issue by claiming her 8 years as First Lady as part of her political experience, but she wasn't really in the hot seat, Bill was.",

It's just that racism negatively affects males, so the patriarchy obsesses over that, while sexism is all about negatively affecting the mostly invisible girls and women. And this nation finds harming females perfectly acceptable, even a cornerstone of the male status quo natural order. Just look at the nearly 100 nations that now have or have had a female leader but not the U.S. Sexism and institutional violent misogyny is as much a facet of this country as is the Pilgrims, 1776, the Civil War, the Statue of Liberty, the 19th amendment 140 years late, Roe v. Wade a century late, July 4th fireworks, the moon walk, and now the nation's best, smartest and grittiest female politician ever - forced to stand near defenseless against endless physical threats and a tirade of insults hurled by the GOP and Republican voters for 30 years. One of the saddest conversations I've been forced to have with my teen daughter was explaining Trump and the tsunami of vulgar, vile threats against Hillary Clinton while also trying to give my girl some sense of hope that the cesspool inhabited by some American men and women will someday soon clean itself up, especially for the safety and mental well-being of females. It hurts when your daughter asks, \"Are we safe?\", knowing she refers to rabid, violent and misogynist neighbors, relatives and fellow Americans. Worse, I can't tell her \"Yes, we are.\" ",

Fast-forward to Republicans' aggressive gerrymandering, oppressive voter ID laws targeting the poor, elderly, black, and Hispanic citizens; outright voter intimidation; reduced voter poll hours/broken machines/not enough machines; and insecure/hack-able electronic voting software. Trump said the \"election would be rigged\" repeatedly.

Trump ran a typical con man's (liar's) game wherein they accuse first their \"mark\" or opponent of scheming to do what they themselves are doing thus raising and directing suspicion away from themselves. <br/><br/> By bringing up the method of the con first, liars believe that they will be granted a pass because they have \"spotted\" the lie first.  A clear example occurred during the debates: recall Donald Trump sniffed his was through the debates- a physical reaction to having snorted adderall - for instance - to stay focused.  This sniffing had happened on other occasions when Trump had to stay focused - when he started using a TelePrompTer.  After the debates, social media was heavily speculating that he was using drugs - the trump team picked this up and responded quickly be suggesting Clinton of used drugs during the debate: the inference was made by trump suggesting Clinton be drug tested before the next debate.  Even the media was fooled by this sleight of hand, quickly shifting to the absurdity of the accusation, taking their eyes off the fact that trump was starting to sniff his way through any appearances that required real focus.  <br/><br/>Trump pulled this scam throughout the campaign, accusing others of what he himself was doing. The psychology behind this is sociopathy and/or narcissism - the liar/trickster covers their nefarious deed by lying and blaming others to manipulate the attention of the credulous away from their own deeds.

People do want change. 72%  of Americans who voted last night believed that \u201cthe economy is rigged to the advantage of the rich and powerful.\u201d Sixty-eight percent agreed that \u201ctraditional parties and politicians don\u2019t care about people like me.\u201d Clinton's policies and history pushing neoliberal economics, bad trade deals and war did not inspire hope. Most of us voted against Trump rather that for Clinton. Most of us a struggling day to day. Most of us do not want war with Russia or more of the same.  I fear Trump. I hope we can learn from Sanders and unite around a stronger progressive vision",

I really appreciate the history and the photographs.<br/><br/>I want you to know that I am married to an extremely smart woman who early on in the campaign said that if Hillary Clinton were a woman she would have been a shoo-in to the Presidency.  I tried to introduce other factors that might have influenced the outcome (nothing original with me only what I read in the Times) but she held fast to the gender as the handicap.  <br/><br/>We watch the news together, because she has the only TV, so when Mrs. C gave her concession speech and closed with the little girl roff, tears began to flow from my wife's eyes.  It was a profound moment.  No one spoke but it was hard to take.  I noticed that her statement also brought tears to Bill's eyes.  <br/><br/>We came out of the same school system and we now in discussion review our grade classes and as I think back in time the smartest person in class was always a female.  The only time I felt that we began to spred apart in academics was in my math and physics classes in the last two years of HS.<br/><br/>I really think we lost out by ending Hillary's career.
