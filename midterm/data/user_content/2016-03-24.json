At the beginning of the meal, one of our party indicated that the nose on the wine was like the essence of good fruit. Later, as the meal progressed, another expressed how much he enjoyed the mouthfeel of the wine, describing how the tannins melted in one's mouth and seemed to seep deep into the tongue, coming back to life for a long lingering finish on every taste bud. Finally, at the end of the meal, we all agreed that the nose and taste of the wine seemed to grow in stature. It soldiered on and on. We look forward to trying more Pomerol wines in the near future.

Her doctor told her if she got pregnant again she would die. So my mother sought guidance from our (horrible) parish priest who said, \"No Birth Control!\" And yet, Catholic wives are supposed to be available for sex when ever the husband wants it. Go figure that one out! I told her that the world is not black and white like the parish priest seemed to think. It is gray and God gave us brains for a reason. He doesn't expect you to die and leave behind a husband and 7 children nor does he expect you to go without conjugal bliss. She went on birth control and is now 82, thank you very much! 'The Pill' is prescribed for many health related reasons, not just birth control (which I personally believe IS health care).",

				"commentBody": "How is it possible anyone can still be asking such a ridiculous question?  Do you object when a man carrying the same insurance policy as yourself has his Cialis covered?  Do you object when a fellow policyholder who is obese required diabetes care?  Do you object when a fellow policyholder's dependent child requires nebulizer treatment?  Do you nitpick over everyone else's minute healthcare details and obsess over which ones you deem worthy of the coverage your common insurance provides, and which ones you object to paying?<br/>One might argue that every insurance payout is a form of coercion, except for the highly relevant fact that the very nature of insurance is a shared pool in which ALL are covered - whether they are women seeking contraception, men with ED, elderly persons on dementia medications, children with ADHD....the list is endless.<br/>\"Fairness\" is a fairly irrelevant term to apply to insurance - and to health, for that matter. It isn't \"fair\" that someone can pay into insurance but never need it for more than an annual checkup. It isn't \"fair\" that a non smoker should get lung cancer. It isn't \"fair\" that drug prices increase so much, so rapidly.<br/>If \"fairness\" is what one seeks in insurance, well - those people must find life terribly difficult to navigate. Unfairness everywhere!",

Some people will still be able to afford Birth Control without insurance, but many won't. For those that cannot afford it, this is the first step in a very dangerous spiral down to back alley abortions. If a woman cannot protect her ability to choose when or if she wants a child, and becomes pregnant, that same woman will undoubtedly run into serious problems with all of the new/recent TRAP laws. She'll have difficulty getting to a clinic that performs abortions, if there's one near her, and those TRAP laws will make her go through days or weeks of red tape. Until, of course, it's too late for a first trimester abortion, which is the purpose of the laws in the first place. Delay, delay, delay. She might be tempted by a back alley abortion, and she may not survive. But do the justices think about the future \"her\"? I imagine that they don't.",

				"commentBody": "Doesn't it all just come down to:  \"Whose plan is it, anyway?\" The conservative Justices seem to think the insurance policy is the school's or hospital's or nursing home's plan. But isn't it really the insurance company's plan to begin with, which the employer provides as part of the employee's compensation package? If so, how is it being \"hijacked\" from the employer. If the employer was an ordinary for-profit business corporation, it would receive a tax deduction for it's cost as a business expense: the the company doesn't buy it for itself, it buys the plan for its employees. Sounds like the insurance belongs to the employees. Whether for or non-profit, the employer could easily<br/> provide a \"flex-benefit\"  cash payment to each employee to buy insurance directly and thus not be taxed on the amount<br/>-- would that cash payment somehow implicate the church-related proprietors in how the employee used that cash? There is no stateable limit to that sort of exception, unless we want to say religiously affiliated employers now must be exempted from the minimum wage or paying any wages at all given that the employees might do something sinful with that money.
