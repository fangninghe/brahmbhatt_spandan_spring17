I am shocked by your casual dismissal of the seriousness of  this. If Trump was a sore loser about the Republican primaries he lost and the Apprentice loss and Ted Cruz's wife and and and - it makes more sense that he is still that same sore loser now, doesn't it?<br/>I other words, there are two possibilities. 1) There's a giant anti-Trump conspiracy that somehow includes anti-Trump Republicans like Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, John McCain, who must be in on the supposed rigging, or 2) Trump is just the sore-loser loose cannon he has always been. Which is more likely, Einstein?",

				"commentBody": "By far the best debate of the three.  I can't believe I am stating this about a Fox News person but Chris Wallace did a very good job, and was fair.   Hillary Clinton was Presidential, was clear in her answers and showed herself to be far more knowledgeable in every area that was covered than Trump, who simply refused to answer many of the questions asked by Mr. Wallace. I doubt Trump's supporters were swayed, but hopefully some voters who had not made up their minds were convinced that Clinton would make a far better President than Trump, based on her intelligent approach to move this country forward.  Trump has no real plans for this country, just a slogan.  He is an empty suit.<br/>I do think the fact that Trump's refusal to state unequivocally that he would accept the election results will stand out in most people's minds.  Also his use of the word hombre was meant to be offensive and that will resonate with many and not in a good way.<br/>For myself, I am just glad the debates are finally over.  This whole election process this year has been exhausting, and draining.",

Cataracts are very fixable now, if you can put total control in the surgeon's hands. Oh that's why. He'll probably just go blind or take a knife to his own eyes).<br/>The rally he tore down the teleprompters at, breaking one, he said he'd pay 20% of the cost.

Maybe he's been a little preoccupied lately seeing the value of his brand collapse.  <br/><br/>This one was over by Round 3.
