In his current capacity, Mr. Patten has done his best in Hong Kong's best interest. He is still fondly remembered by the locals and what he says does carry an awful lot of weight.",

There is not a single democracy I've lived in, including the United States, that match anywhere the efficiency and nationalism of authoritarian Asian states. <br/><br/>Democracy, for all intents and purposes, is a backwards mode of government that deludes its people into thinking being humane or having equally distributed political power is somehow progress. <br/><br/>Have a look at the protestors in Hong Kong. Nearly all youths with no grasp of history or hierarchy. They are the same kind of social detritus who base their political views on what is or isn't \"nice\". As it stands, the mature hierarchs of Hong Kong should be glad that the mainland shields it from democracy. ",

				"commentBody": "I agree with Mr Patten's views. <br/><br/>From the outside, HK is essentially viewed as a peculiar part of China, which for historical reasons, has been made a testbed for bounded democracy. However, we sense that the Chinese government feels that they are being somewhat generous to HK. Beijing is therefore incensed that rather than feeling grateful, HK is not only seeking more freedom, but even considering independence. <br/><br/>I am not a student of history, but there seems to be very few instances where a state or part of a country can peacefully exit a country without any bloodshed. Even in the USA, if say, California wants to leave the union, it is probably not going to happen as peacefully as the British leaving the EU bloc (which is technically not a country). Taking the relationship between Taiwan and China, you can see how nationalistic things can get when the issue of independence comes up.<br/><br/>As it is difficult to imagine civil war breaking out, or for HK to be truly separate from China, arguing and reasoning for a higher quality of democracy within the confines of Beijing's dictates probably has the greatest chance of success.",

Both produce mollases, the sap boiled until it thickens.  Sorghum mollases has a distinctive flavor, richer than regular mollases from sugar cane.<br/><br/>Blackstrap mollases is the dregs left in the boiler after the sugar has been extracted.  It is extremely strong with minerals it contains, and is not suitable for cooking or table use.  It is used medicinally for the minerals and formerly as a \"spring tonic.\"  No one would make a pie or cookies with it, unless he relished bitterness.",

				"commentBody": "This is a great article, but there seems to be some confusion not only about the difference between dialects and accents, but also dialects and languages. The linked Reuters article from which the inference that \"many\" of \"nearly 100 Chinese dialects\" are spoken by China's 55 recognized ethnic minorities actually states that there are over 100 _languages_ spoken by China's ethnic minorities. Clearly many of these languages, like Tibetan and Uyghur, are not Chinese, while at the same time, many ethnic minorities like the Hui will speak the Chinese dialect or accent of their community or nearby population centers, like Chengdu or Kunming for instance, which would have nothing to do with their ethnicity. Further complicating these distinctions is Cantonese which, when I referred to it once as a \"dialect\" I was sternly corrected by a venerable historical linguist of Chinese who insisted that Cantonese is a language apart from Putonghua. I didn't pursue the issue, but this might also apply to other \"dialects\" like Shanghainese. The article is clearly about Beijing dialect, but the 100 number from the UN seems to be of languages spoken in China, not dialects.<br/><br/>By the way, in addition to the project to save Beijinghua, there has since about 2013 been a great international project of preserving all of China's dialects and languages by recording them and posting the recordings to an online interactive map, a kind of digital oral history of China's languages. <a href=\"http://www.phonemica.net\" title=\"www.phonemica.net\" target=\"_blank\">www.phonemica.net</a>.

They are 'old Beijing', which despite what others may say in the comments, is becoming increasingly harder to find. While that makes me sad, it's the natural by-product of a city that has seen rapid, significant growth in the past decade; to hope otherwise would be naive. I grew up outside China but thanks to my parents I speak Chinese with what I'm often told is a Beijing accent, full of marbles and r's. It's a cultural marker and one that I'm proud of. I might not be able to speak the \"tu hua\" (transliterally, dirt speech), full of colourful vernacular and vocabulary only a native Beijinger would know, which is what I *think* this author was trying to get at, but whenever I hear an increasing rare phrase or two of it on the street, it's a wonderful throwback.
