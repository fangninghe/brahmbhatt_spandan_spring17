Long story short, for Western countries, tests are predominately viewed as part of the means to an end. There's a time after tests when all this knowledge is useless if it can't be applied in practical situations.<br/><br/>From what I've seen of the Chinese system, the test is the end, with no thought given to what comes next.<br/><br/>Which is why you get such a dramatic difference in results once school is finished (personally I'm a high school dropout that's now managing very large government computer networks. When doing this, I deal with Chinese teams fairly regularly on some side stuff... The quality is not remotely the same. Although far better than India)",

				"commentBody": "This comment caught my eye: \"Sounds as though the NC voters have cut off their collective nose to spite their face.\"<br/><br/>As a North Carolina voter, it feels instead like my nose has been cut off without my consent. The GOP legislators behind HB2, and failure to repeal, hail from voting districts so gerrymandered that they were recently ruled unconstitutional for intentionally diluting the power of minority voters with what the ruling called \"surgical precision.\" In 2016, Republican state house candidates won a small majority of votes (52% to 47%). Yet, they control a veto-proof majority of house seats (62% to 38%). GOP gerrymandering has transformed a 5% difference in votes to a 24% difference in legislative representation.<br/><br/>Without years of insidious voter suppression measures targeted at minority groups and other constituencies likely to vote for Democrats, the NC vote would likely be closer to 50-50. This year, the NC GOP chair sent emails instructing local election boards, \"Republicans can and should make party line changes to early voting,\" making clear that efforts masked as \"voter fraud prevention\" have all along been aimed at partisan voter suppression. And GOP cries of \"voter fraud\" after the 2016 gubernatorial election were deemed baseless - by Republican election board members, no less.<br/><br/>As a voter, confronted by an electoral system that NC Republicans are tilting so far from democracy, I just hope these power-hungry hypocrites eventually do cut off their own noses.",

Americans has a very short attention span so they move onto another group soon. As long as a sub-culture makes a lot of noise (usually grossly disproportionate to its size), proves to be politically useful to a left leaning politician who does not give a damn the subculture or its goals, and has a famous member - usually from Hollywood rather than the business world - and gets a few musicians to boycott any place that doesn't support the subculture they didn't know existed a week ago, then transgender rights will become \"retro\" and be little more than a joke in popular culture.

				"commentBody": "Correct-North Carolina fits the definition of a failed state in many ways. Blatant baptist religion has entered the state government-in fact is directing the course of the government. The bathroom bill was a smoke screen to hid the ugly realities of the bill-HB2. With much of the rural population under sway of religious ignorance, undereducated, poorly informed, NC will continue down the path toward their real religion-based goals-end of abortion, end of gay marriage-end of LGBT persons and if they could manage it, the eradication of civil rights of black persons.<br/>If this sounds like an otherworld vision from another country in another continent in another era-it is what some parts of America really are like-and where others are headed under the Trump authoritarian system.<br/>The state should be subjected to a continual barrage of shunning-by groups and individuals who do not want their presence to be seen as an endorsement. The message may get through with dire economic strategies-but the real issue is the hearts and souls of the voters who put these Republicans into their statehouse. The state seems to have let the long time presence of right wing ignorance come to the top. Time for persons in the state who do not want a theocracy to make some noise. ",
