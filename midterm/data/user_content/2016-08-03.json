I'm afraid this may sound sexist (In my defense I can only say I'd be avidly supporting Nancy Pelosu or Liz Warren), but I feel that Hillary has me by the short hairs.  I'll vote for her, but that's it.  I'm finished with the Democatic Party, except for supporting progressive candidates in the primaries.",

				"commentBody": "It's incredible to see how hard the New York Times is rooting for a particular candidate.  I understand that Hillary Clinton is, and always has been, a thoroughgoing establishment politician, of the kind that the paper would like to have in power.  Nevertheless, the New York Times should at least feigned an attempt to hold the Democratic Party responsible for the categorical fact that it tried to sway the primaries--even if only to maintain its own veneer of fairness and its standing as the liberal voice of record.<br/><br/>Of course, Trump responded to the interviewer's question about the fallen Muslim soldier like an idiot.  If he had any intelligence, he would have expressed sympathy to the parents for their loss, and pointed out that if Capt. Humayun Khan had not been deployed in an illegal war that was supported by Clinton enthusiastically, he could have been with his family today.<br/><br/>A lot of people complain about the things Trump says about specific issues, whether military, or geo-political, or economic.  On the other hand, most people against Clinton, including the Sanders Democrats, object to the very positions taken by Clinton, not just her well-rehearsed descriptions of her positions.  This concerted media onslaught against Trump is actually a proxy propaganda war against Vladimir Putin.  Let us hope that some sanity prevails, and the great powers do not come to war in the course of the next few years.",

				"commentBody": "The trajectory of Trump's candidacy reminds me of the movie and Broadway play, \"The Producers.\"  Trump seems to be doing everything he can, and I mean everything folks, to ensure a huge failure for his candidacy in November.  Insulting a Gold Star Family and a fallen American hero is beyond the pale, even for DJT.  In the language of Wall Street, he seems to be \"shorting\" his own run.<br/><br/>That's all ok, until you remember how The Producers ended.  <br/><br/>It may not be \"Springtime for Hitler\", only because the season is wrong.  So maybe \"Autumn Leaves for Trump\" will be a big musical hit later this year.<br/><br/>Sure hope not.",

				"commentBody": "It's not only WikiLeaks that is likely to change public opinion. Any further breakout of either police killings or ISIS terrorism will do much to focus the minds of the public on real, as opposed to media manufactured, issues in this election.<br/><br/>And I think that the debates will also favor Trump, although one can predict as well that his performance will be panned by everyone in the increasingly obviously biased media. Why will he be favored? Because, on the issues, it is Clinton, and not Trump, who is totally out of touch with the public. <br/><br/>Who in the larger public thinks that BLM is anything but bad news? Who in the larger public thinks, as does Hillary, that the answer to ISIS terrorism is a vast increase in the number of Muslims allowed to immigrate? Who in the larger public thinks that our exercises in power in Libya and Syria and Iraq have been anything but disasters? Who in the larger public thinks that increased immigration, and globalistic trade deals profits American workers?<br/><br/>The one thing Hillary can't survive is an election based on the issues. And Trump should be able to communicate his position on these issues, and contrast them with Hillary. ",

				"commentBody": "It's certainly a good idea to challenge the influence of ISIS in Libya but, once again, why is the U.S. playing the key role here?  That terrorist organization has already murdered Egyptian citizens in eastern Libya and impacted the flow of refugees across the Mediterranean to Italy.  Where is the Egyptian air force?  Where are the Italians?  And even if we manage to drive ISIS out of Surt and other areas in Tripolitania they'll most likely head south into Fezzan and then across the Sahel.  ISIS shouldn't be dealt with with pinpricks, whether in Libya, Syria or Iraq.  What's needed is a U.N.-authorized force made up of every nation threatened by these barbarians- including the U.S., Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Italy, our other Western European allies, Egypt and every other Sunni Arab nation.  Why have we not even petitioned the U.N. for such authorization?  His failure to do so is, to my mind, one of Mr. Obama's biggest mistakes on the foreign policy front- far more so than the well-intended decision to establish a no-fly zone to stop Qaddafi from reaching Benghazi.

Yet, the whole point of the article is to go beyond that knee-jerk feeling and see deeper into what a veteran **player** presence brings. I don't like Arod. But since his 2015 return, someone put some sense into him, and finally he's doing everything exactly right. You can't ask more of a man, of a professional, than that. The article also notes how it makes little sense to release him this year. The team is out of contention and rosters will expand soon. They can release him next spring. The Yanks aren't trying to help him get to 700. It looks like they might even be happy if he doesn't.",
