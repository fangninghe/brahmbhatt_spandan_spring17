You generalize when he says women should be paid less;he meant female tennis players because they play only two of three instead of three of five. I agree with him and I've heard that some of the female players want to play more......<br/>Gracious, mais oui! Generous, certainement....and, he no longer beats his chest!",

				"commentBody": "My approximately 20 home subdivision was built just outside the Atlanta City limits in 30342 in 1961-1965. The homes started at just over 2,000 sf ranch with 2 baths in 1961 then progressed to 2,800-3,300 two half bath two story homes by 1964-65. Most of the homes had  gunite pools added in the mid to late 60's as they had kids. <br/><br/>Now as can even be seen on Bravo's Real Housewifes of Atlanta, neighboring houses outside my subdivision are being torn down to build 4,500-12,000 sf. McMansions with 10' Ceilings. ( The houses from the 50's to 80's only have 8' ceilings and 4/12 roof pitches.  Which makes them smaller volumes.) Bravo's infamous Chateau Sheree is less than 1 mile south or mine. Surrounding it are other examples of the new larger rebuilds with million dollar price tags. <br/><br/>I and several of my neighbors in our little 20 home enclave have simply chosen to rework the original space or pop out Master bath additions. I took two small bedrooms and combined them for a Master Bedroom Suite. Then closed off the odd jack n Jill baths, so now the remaining two bedrooms each have their own. I am in process of converting the outdated formal living into a first floor bedroom and bath. I will still have a great room which I opened the kitchen to the first week. The grand piano room is a versatile office/den for us.  The only limiting factor is the 8' ceilings. <br/><br/>I just have to fight to keep my tax appraisal down with the tax man. ",

First it was Jamie after losing his hand, then Theon after becoming Reek, and even Cersei after the humiliating walk of atonement.  Now they seem to have done it with the Hound. It's rather skillful storytelling.  <br/><br/>Arya's situation just got a whole lot more interesting.  I was thinking that she would be able to hold her own with the Waif and maybe even kill her.  I didn't understand why she was behaving so casually given that she had defied her orders to kill the actress. <br/><br/>I am looking forward to seeing Brienne and Jamie meet up again.  I thought this Riverrun storyline was one that had been sacrificed for the sake of time.  Also surprised to see the Brotherhood without Banners again.  That may hint at the return of another abandoned storyline that fans have been asking for.",

I don't think The Hound was ever a really bad character. He was pressed into fighting, actually, slaughtering people, early on due to his size, but he seemed to always try to do the right thing when he could. Anyway, I too am glad he's back. <br/><br/>I don't understand Arya's demeanor either. You would think that she would have learned by now that you can't take anything for granted. In fact, you would think all of the Starks -- halfbloods included -- would have learned that lesson by now. They constantly overestimate the fealty to the Stark name -- 62 soldiers, really? I jokingly said two during that scene and wasn't too far off --and underestimate their enemies to their everlasting sorrow. I really do want them to win -- retake Winterfell, rescue their brother and all that -- and reunite, but they simply have to accept the world for what it is and not for what they want it to be. ",

The Margery/Olenna/Sparrow subplot was so plodding for what it achieved; they could have wrapped up that little bit of plot advancement in less than half the time. Sansa and Jon going door-to-door looking for armies was oddly absurd, although it did provide the episodes's one highlight--little Lady Lyanna. The Hound's return has potential but seeing Ian McShane's character gone as quickly as he arrived was depressing even for a show with so much death. The episode even ended early. There better be some mighty big payoff before season's end.",

				"commentBody": "Good Evening: Back in my wine industry days, the rule for Rose wine and food pairings went as follows--pink on pink. This week marks the 13th anniversary of when I wiped out my credit card debt forever. To celebrate, the Commanderie de Peyrassol 2015 with a platter of prosciutto, porchetta, smoked salmon, strawberries, raspberries, cherry tomatoes with olive oil and Zatar, and a wedge of St. Andre cheese with crackers. The music? A Geneva jazz harmonica player named Gregoire Maret and his self-titled 2012 CD. The food pairings succeeded: best with the fruit and cheese; very good with the smoked salmon and pork; satisfactory with the cherry tomatoes.<br/><br/>As for the wine itself, I would describe the color as a very pale salmon-pink. The nose: cherry, raspberry, strawberry, floral, and a real surprise--mineral, like the Austrian Rieslings of a few months ago. The taste: same as the nose, plus what I can only describe as pomegranate. Most interesting: the crisp, high acid body and the mineral character, which really helps the wine stand up to, and augment, the cheese, salmon and meats. Would probably work with a baked or grilled whole fish.<br/><br/>In honor of my 13th anniversary, I improvised a cocktail. Muddle two sliced strawberries and 8 raspberries in the bottom of a pint glass. Add 6 ounces of the Peyrassol or other Rose. Fill with seltzer, stir gently to float the fruit, add a few ice cubes. Garnish with a sprig of mint.<br/><br/>I call it the Freedom Pink.",

He knows she is a formidable foe and wants her away, while also breaking up the joint force of Lannister and Tyrell. So he got Margaery to get Oleana out of the way, knowing that nobody else would be able to do it. That means he is wise to what Margeary's act, and is using her instead of the other way round.",

There is no way that you are only paying $500 in taxes on a house the tax accesser has appraised at $250,000. You would have a .83% tax rate, I just looked it up. The average house is $258K and pays $2150 in property taxes ( approx.) . You must be over 65 and have the exemption from School taxes. Then you must also have a disability exemption, or a disabled veterans exemption on your county tax portion.  If not the tax man will soon find out that your property is not correctly appraised, because you should be paying an amount equal to .83% the value to live way outside the city.  As growth continues and the need for infrastructure increases in proportion. Larger courthouse, jail, more administration, more police, fire, more roads, more schools, etc... they will raise the taxes. Ask those in Cobb, Gwinnett, what has happened to them. The same folks keep moving out for the cheaper housing. ",

I had this wild idea that the Waif was going to do something horrible in her body and get her killed. It didn't make sense when I thought of it, but I just couldn't reconcile this scene with last week. <br/><br/>Also, the whole scene with the Hound and his marry bend of pacifists was pretty comical in some ways. It was pretty heavy-handed and you knew immediately what was going to happen to all of them. I think if the showrunners let the scene breathe, it would have been more impactful.
