And this was long before \"Pharaoh\" Mubarak's overthrow.<br/><br/>Now, of course, it's infinitely more dangerous.<br/><br/>The Holy Qur'an might be a great book -- but it is only a book; its verses interpreted and reinterpreted by Islamic scholars.

				"commentBody": "Never, ever underestimate the power of propaganda.  Never, ever underestimate the ease that people can be persuaded.  Never, ever underestimate the desperation that people have for authority figures to tell them what they want to hear.<br/><br/>Such is the success of voter fraud.  Here is how it works.<br/><br/>Everyone I know voted for my guy.  My guy didn't win.  How could that happen?  The election must be rigged.  All these high ranking officials in government tell me that the election was rigged by voter fraud.  My trusted sources of news tell me, and almost daily, that voter fraud is rampant.  They even have all these studies to prove it. But the left wing media led by the New York Times and that socialist PBS say the studies are false.  They are the real liars.  Besides there are 11 million illegals here and all they have to do is walk in and vote.  Millions of votes against my guy.<br/><br/>See how easy it is.  All of the motivation and stimulus is there to cause people to swallow the entire voter fraud lie.  The true fraud is perpetuating that voter fraud exists.  But that is easy to get away with.  Example: We all know that Obama really was born in Kenya.  Trump just said he was born here to make the establishment Republicans happy.  But we know the real truth. He's a Kenyan Muslim.  The real lie is that he isn't.<br/><br/>That's how the voter fraud myth works.  What's really scary is that the myth pushers are so immersed in the lie, they truly believe it themselves.",
