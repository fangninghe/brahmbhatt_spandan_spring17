				"commentBody": "Lone idiots have been killing people in this country for generations.  Mad at the world about this or that.  Leon Czolgosz murdered President McKinley - he was an anarchist.  John Hinkley was trying to get a date with Jodie Foster.   <br/><br/>Ironically, it's easier to detect these people now - because we have computerized tools to track gun purchases quickly and Facebook pages to spout their egotistical rants.  But the gun people won't accept that guns ought to be monitored and the privacy people don't want anybody looking at your Facebook page, even if you're spewing violent bile about killing Jews, or Senators or women, or Americans or whatever.  <br/><br/>People who want to kill strangers for ideological reasons - no matter how shallow - are egomaniacs on steroids.  The only answer is to detect them quickly before they do something.  <br/><br/>Lincoln had no way of knowing what Booth was plotting.  Kennedy and the Dallas cops had no way of knowing what was going on in Oswald's mind.  But if they both lived today they would be on social media ranting about their intentions.  Sic semper tyranis!<br/><br/>The Unabomber was caught because he could not resist the need to explain himself - he killed and maimed people for years before he slipped up.  The killers in San Bernardino put all the evidence out there - but we were too polite as a society to look out for it.  <br/><br/>We should know if angry people are buying assault weapons.  The capability is there.  Will we take advantage of it?",

All it takes is one other person who is brave enough, and knowledgeable enough, to take action.<br/><br/>A person threatened, or otherwise aware of the threats, can make a complaint with the police. The internet threats can be copied onto a disc or thumb drive and shown to the police.<br/><br/>If warranted, the police can obtain a warrant to search an internet account if a person threatens to harm others online. Then the internet threats become evidence and the threatening person can be arrested. <br/><br/>If the District Attorney prosecutes, the court can order bail in a high amount or even hold a suspect without bail until the person appears in court and, if ordered to do so, undergoes a psychological evaluation.  If the charges and evidence warrant, the court can order that the threatening person be jailed or sent to a mental hospital.<br/><br/>Of course, the threatened person is granted various restraining orders throughout this process.<br/><br/>This is an action that can be taken by a person who feels that his or her life is in danger, or that other lives are in danger.

							"commentBody": "@Brooklyn Traveler<br/><br/>Interesting what you shared about Facebook pages being off limits to investigators. How is Facebook private information when people are posting their personal information online for all the world to see?  It boggles the mind.  It boggles the mind even more that someone on the terrorist watch list is not allowed to board a commercial airplane but can walk into a gun shop and purchase a military assault rifle no questions asked!  <br/><br/>Personally I think we should:<br/>1) Re-instate the assault weapons ban.<br/>2) Check all potential gun purchasers against the no fly list<br/>3) Check all potential gun purchasers against a database of known domestic abusers.<br/>4) Make the social media activity of suspected terrorists available to law enforcement officers. I can't believe it is not already.<br/><br/>Those steps may not end all gun related mass shootings but they might prevent some which is a lot better than sitting on our hands, making excuses and feeling helpless.  Will the almighty NRA and their bought and paid for lackeys in the GOP listen to reason?  Probably not. And enough treasonous innuendo! No politician or candidate in either party should be making irresponsible allegations about our commander in chief being in league with the terrorists! The only way we will win the war on ISIS is to stick together and fight as one nation. <br/><br/>\"We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.\" Ben Franklin",

Like in a particle accelerator or the Big Bang.<br/><br/>One can show that in any model for it, the space must be filled by, to put it simply, computations. <br/><br/>Physically they are the inner symmetry of the matter, so in a way they are the matter itself.<br/><br/>The usual math is binary, you add 2+3 and get 5. Organized in the shape of the letter Y with 2 and 3 entering and 5 exiting. The usual math fills this way only 2 dimensional surfaces, 1 space+1 time. The models of this kind are used on a 2d sheet, which is the string in string theory.<br/><br/>Particles, however, interact strongly with 3space+1time, and cannot therefore be caught by a 2d string.<br/><br/>Instead one needs some new, higher math, which fills 4d space. This is what I have developed for many years and will put out in a course.<br/><br/>What I found, unexpectedly, was that the higher computations are encoded into bends , or foldings, of space time. Which bends satisfy precisely Einstein's equations.<br/><br/>In the model I am aiming at, the lifelines of particles \u2013 lines as time passes \u2013 are surrounded by such computations. The only important things, as in all of science, are things which can be measured, which are probabilities for things to happen.<br/><br/>These would arise from angles, computed between the part representing the experimenter and the experiment.",

You say in this paragraph:<br/><br/>\"In the model I am aiming at, the lifelines of particles \u2013 lines as time passes \u2013 are surrounded by such computations. The only important things, as in all of science, are things which can be measured, which are probabilities for things to happen.\"<br/><br/>If the only important things are \"things that can be measured\", why are you aiming at a model?<br/><br/>Second point: you call \"probabilities for things to happen\" things which can be measured.<br/><br/>Climate science is the study of past, current and theoretical climate and underlying mechanisms - in part to help us determine the probabilities of things to happen.  Every parcel (or particle) of air or sea water is \"surrounded by computations\".<br/><br/>So you are doing exactly what climate scientists do - studying existing physical systems, developing models, making probabilistic predictions and measuring the results.  Oh, and taking government grants to do this work.<br/><br/>Will you be consistent and call yourself all the names you call others for doing the exact same things?",

				"commentBody": "Watching Trump and his campaign implode is the greatest schadenfreude there is ... and there's a cherry on top: he's destroyed the GOP too.<br/><br/>Trump is the most perfect example of the Dunning-Kruger effect we've seen in a long time, and his major demonstration is that 30+ % of America are alike.<br/><br/>The very large fraction of rational people look at what it takes to become president, what it then takes to do that job, how it ages people, how many get shot ... and thinks \"fuggedaboutit.\"  <br/><br/>Trump thought \"Ooh la la! I'm great! I'll be President! it'll be great! Think about my brand!\"<br/><br/>And now it is all coming home to roost: every cheap grifting scheme the man did is being unearthed -- was he so dumb as to not think that through? <br/><br/>All the old-school Republicans are indeed conspiring against him, and he's got the full-throated opposition of ...  let's see:  blacks, hispanics, women, most educated whites  .. how's yer brand doing, Trump?<br/><br/>His political campaign itself is circling the drain, and there's 4 months to go.  <br/><br/>Trump is going to be remembered as one of the dumbest wannabees in history -- the faker who pulled back his own curtain, and stepped out into full view.<br/><br/>And his best trick: quitting, sucking out the money and letting the suckers eat the bankruptcy isn't so easy to do for a presidential candidate.<br/><br/>In all this beautiful schadenfreude -- couldn't happen to a more deserving pack -- there is one thing to fear.  Trump's angry-loser base will still be with us.  ",
