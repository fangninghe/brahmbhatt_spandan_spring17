The tax on short-term capital gains, i.e., assets held for less than a year, is the same as ordinary income tax. The long-term capital gains tax rate is a ceiling, not a flat rate. If a person's income is modest, he or she may already pay little to no taxes on his or her capital gains. Unlike real losses on other assets, for example, a home, capital gains can be offset by capital losses for tax purposes.<br/><br/>Considering that investing in the stock market is about the only way to effectively generate a high enough return on savings to fund one's retirement, the question is why more Americans don't do it.
