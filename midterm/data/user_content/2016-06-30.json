Just because a fact doesn't fit a someone's specific religious or heteronormative world view, doesn't make the fact any less true. It appears that for some readers, the fact that the massacre could be motivated by both radical Islam and homophobia is untenable. In reality, one begets the other. Islam preaches, and Islamic states carry out, the execution of gays. That is a fact.",

The reality is people win athletic events primarily because of genetics, training and drugs, and people with the right genetics tend to respond better to training and drugs.  That someone can run  400 meters faster than another person really has little meaning.  So the idea of paying a lot of attention to who wins an athletic cost  is primarily watching who has the genetics for the event.  Just trying won't do it.  So on the average men will win a lot of events preferentially over women because of their genetics.  If we segregate athletics into medically or culturally defined sex, gender or whatever you want to call it you are again primarily looking at who has the best genetics. in that subgroup. ",

Like the article pointed out, it seems incredibly unfair to be barring certain women because of their supposed unfair advantage due to elevated testosterone levels, while we don't even check to see if high-performing men have abnormally high testosterone levels, which should be equally unfair to other men. I support categorizing based on self-identification. If a person is raised and lives as a female, they can compete as a female. No men in disguise have ever been caught so far, and besides, the playing field is already completely unequal: there are a myriad other factors that contribute to an athlete's success, such as lung capacity, muscle fiber composition, nutrition, parental involvement, and training, to name a few.",

				"commentBody": "What \"looks masculine\" and \"looks feminine\"  is not an objective opinion, but determined by cultural bias , which in our cultural is largely determined  by advertising. The multi-billion dollar cosmetic industry sells products to females to alter every inch of their body in order to look \"feminine\". For example, women in North America shave their legs, armpits and upper lip to \"look feminine\", but women in some European cultures do not have to shave their body hair to be considered \"feminine\".  Similarly, having a strong, muscular physique has nothing to do with what is is biologically natural for women, but everything to do with convincing women that they should look soft and weak to be \"feminine\". A woman can stop menstruating temporarily for a variety of reasons and that is natural too since her body is not designed to give birth continuously from puberty to menopause. And who says that giving birth is not \"heavy work\"? It requires more physical stamina and endurance than running a 100 yard dash! ",

My Congressional Representative is retiring after almost a half-century in the House, so the parties nominated non-incumbents. A Washington publication that is distributed gratis on Capitol Hill ran this article about the District and its departing incumbent:<br/><br/><a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/espaillat-declares-victory-charlie-rangels-new-york-seat\" title=\"http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/espaillat-declares-victory-charlie-rangels-new-york-seat\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/espaillat-declares-victory-charlie...</a> <br/><br/>If anyone clicks that and reads the penultimate paragraph, I wonder if they could confirm/refute my opinion that there are 2 unfortunately-chosen words in its 3 lines.<br/><br/>1. It says he \"received\" a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Having read prior Comments, I take the stance that he \"earned\" those decorations when -- during fighting in the Korean conflict that preceded the current Armistice -- he led his men to safety after they had been encircled by (mainland) Chinese troops. [As far as I know, he is the last remaining member of the House who participated in combat in Korea in the 50s.]<br/><br/>2. The writer uses the same word that follows BRIGHTLY in today's grid. The man in question has indeed had a checkered history in the House. He was censured for ethics violations; but he also co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Elsewhere, transgendered persons won nominations for a House seat from Colo. and a Senate seat from Utah.

I agree it's an unfortunate choice of words but not quite what I feared. <br/><br/>As to your other point, Wikipedia does say that he 'earned' them. I would tend to go with 'earned' for the Bronze star and 'received' for the Purple Heart, as the latter is largely the 'luck of the draw' so to speak. <br/><br/>Actually had a discussion with two friends on this very subject within the last month and have also have talked with a former officer about the medal thing in the past. The officer once explained to me that deciding that a soldier deserves a medal and writing a citation that will actually get approved are two entirely different matters, and he noted that the majority of his submissions were rejected or sent back with suggestions for re-wording. <br/><br/>In discussions with my friends, I was surprised to learn that we all tended to regard certain medals as, essentially, lifetime achievement awards even though they are always actually awarded for a specific incident. I think that reflects the officer's dilemma in some respects. <br/><br/>Lastly, we all agreed that on the telegram home one is always 'slightly' wounded but that on the medal citation one is always 'seriously' wounded. See above. <br/><br/>Oh, and from what I read, I think Rangel definitely earned at least a Silver Star, even though he received the Bronze. ",
