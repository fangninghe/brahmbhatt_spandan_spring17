When egregious conduct by the police is beyond the ability of politicians to suppress coverage of it then the Justice Dept. is called in.

A federal judge will then act as a monitor to determine if agreed-upon reforms are actually instituted.<br/><br/>Except, nothing really changes when racism is institutionalized to the point where it's not just learned but handed down to the next generation of police officers. It's a bandaid to the those communities suffering from that racism when they know only major surgery will help.<br/><br/> Perhaps the Justice Dept. will remember the second word in its name and think about justice. We keep hearing about the need for a *national* conversation on racial bias in police departments, but when is the Justice Dept. going to put its money where its mouth is? Same old, same old doesn't cut it and nor does merely inserting a federal judge, no matter how honest, into a battle that can't be won by a jurist alone.",

I have noticed that most people, whatever their circumstances, prefer to see themselves as part of the \"middle class\" than the poor.  Although I would not want to offend struggling more than I am, I consider myself (and many people that I see on a day to day basis) on the cusp of poverty, whether or not we wish to recognize it.  It is simply extremely difficult to survive in today's United States, despite all of our superficial consumption benefits.  The wealth is concentrated at the top with a facade of a middle class that threatens to disappear immediately if another financial crisis occur.  I really wish that our political candidates would realize this and institute real, immediate policies to at least attempt to put the economy in functional order.  If that does not happen, we are all in for a rocky ride, I believe, in the near future.  ",

Our major newspapers were little more than lapdogs. Publishers and city editors took instructions from the Daley Machine that wrecked Chicago. Although The Machine doesn't hold sway like it once did they are mere shadows of what they once were; bland, toothless, pathetic relics, actually.<br/><br/>Otherwise, our problems are virtually identical. Our West Bawl'mer is Southside \"below 3500\", and ancient suburbs with names like \"Cicero\", \"Little Village\", \"Garfield Park\" and \"Harvey\". Drugs are plentiful, guns and life are cheap, gangs hold sway, the code is silence and revenge, and police sometimes play judge, jury and executioner -- or exact \"tribute\" from local residents unfortunate enough to cross their path, just like they do in \"Bawl'mer\".",

It is about time an investigation was conducted on their treatment as they attempt to get justice through the system.

How can any rape survivor get justice when those sworn to protect and indict are too busy further degrading/ignoring these women than actually doing their taxpayer funded jobs. Some women are raped and discriminated by the police who appear to have never been investigated. No one should ever wonder why many rapes go unreported in their city or town. These neanderthals exist in every courthouse and precinct across this country.<br/><br/>The rape itself is extremely difficult to overcome and the long term effects last a lifetime. Survivors often lose economic stability, suffer severe mental anguish and trusting relationships are almost impossible. Suicide and drug abuse are very common because the pain and misery are daily challenges which tax the soul.<br/><br/>Only time will tell if this report forces the judicial system to change the way they approach these women.

Black people, especially men, have often given their lives, freedom and sanity for America. Yes, even their sanity, as the pervasive effect on a person in a cage from which they cannot escape as the world goes on like they do not matter, indeed, do not exist. It is maddening.<br/><br/>The damages have been done, are being done and some will continue until there are justices on SCOTUS that begin to understand how horrific it has been as it happened out in the open for all who would open their eyes to see. The statement that justice is blind holds and, as Richard Pryor said, \"She is white too.\" <br/><br/>The legacy of Barack Obama will also contain that he started the ball to rolling at revealing the true brutality done to blacks. The legacy of Clarence Thomas will be worse than that of Antonin Scalia, no more potent a Judas ever existed. But the real heroes are all those people out there with those ever rolling cameras and the officials who finally prevailed in getting cameras on officers and in squad cars. A personal bit of thanks go to the free-lance reporter who exposed the LaQuan McDonald scandal in Chicago who really kicked the who can over, Mr. Brandon Smith, a true freedom patriarch. Who fought for release of videos when the big organizations would not.<br/><br/>World Peace",

I find some hope in the fact that this is the first time this is being studied on a national level.  I hope that, by bringing these issues to light, this is a step in the direction to finding solutions.  The insidiousness of these issues are more complicated to remedy than some of the larger political battles, but I feel stronger to be part of a culture that has survived some tough times and still still thrives.  Thanks, raven55, for being part of that culture.",
