				"commentBody": "So far this century, African American actors have made up a slightly larger percentage of best-actor/actress Oscar nomination than they do of the U.S. population, but it\u2019s not surprising none were nominated this year. For example, African American males make up about 6 percent of the U.S. population, but probably less than 3 percent of actors eligible for best actor nominations. (The Oscars only go to actors in English-language films made anywhere in the world. This excludes most films made in Asia, Africa and Latin America. ) A black male nominated for best actor would take up 20 percent of best actor nominations. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect 20 percent of best actor award nominations go to such a small segment of eligible actors every year. The same is true for actresses, directors and screenwriters. ",

				"commentBody": "Hatred and racism as a response to differences is ultimately alienating and separating whether expressed by Roxane Gay or Donald Trump. Most stark in this discourse as with Ta-Nehisi Coates and others is equating inherently \"human experience\" as exclusive to race and color identity. In my parents \"conversations\" between 7-10 I was warned about the dangers of the street, the building, its' elevator, the basement, child molesters and strangers, the subway, etcetera. I too was poor: parents slept in living room, shared bedroom with brother, landlord came looking for the rent. Not every injustice and failure to get what you want, to be liked, acknowledged or recognized is due to skin color or poverty. The depth of hatred, the retrograde tone toward \"white\" skin and privilege is both revelation and reminder. Emotionally steeped in deep hatred whatever apparently moves in your favor yet you still lose. Love, appreciation and acceptance cannot be legislated. What is the need in the cry to be nominated? Will a quota calm your heart, ease your pain? If seeking love and recognition is the game, hatred and anger are ultimately an ill conceived strategy whether you are black, brown, cream, ochre, yellow, alabaster or white, with or without privilege. Aggression and hatred veiled as true expression denigrate the viable human aspirations for inclusion and unity, ironically create more of the separation you decry. Wishing you well on your personal journey to wholeness.",

				"commentBody": "Can we just get it over with and pass a law requiring that all professions, all institutions, and the distribution of prestigious awards must reflect the racial and ethnic makeup of society? Those who bemoan \"underrepresentation\" are often inconsistent and unprincipled, as they want select races or one gender to be at least proportionally represented, but not all or both. They want what they want for members of the tribes they favor, and that's it. <br/><br/>In my line of work, academia, in the absence of such a law, we routinely bend over backwards to hire female and minority graduate students with little or no teaching or publishing experience over highly accomplished white male PhD's for the few tenure track jobs that even exist any more. If the ads simply said, e.g., \"no white males need apply, we already have people who look like you,\" at least it would be honest. We would no longer be treating people as we would never consent to be treated ourselves - being unemployed, seeing a job we'd love to have, getting our hopes up, putting great time and effort into applying for it, not knowing the whole time that we have no chance of getting it because of the race and/or gender into which we were born. <br/><br/>If Ms. Gay is going to insinuate that social justice demands proportional representation by race and ethnicity across the board, I look forward to her advocacy of such a law. A lot of Jews, for example, will lose their jobs, but I'm sure Ms. Gay will be fine with that.  ",

Instead I married a woman whose wisdom, compassion and knowledge make everyday a celebration of life. Even as we enter our dotage her beauty still shines through the wrinkles and I have a friend , love and companion to share the important things in life.<br/>One of the great puzzles I am dealing with right now is why someone with all the money in the world, certainly more than average intelligence, great charm and charisma, and 10 months from claiming the most powerful office on the planet would welcome Sarah on HIS stage.",

Perhaps no one in your limited circle claims the river was polluted, but people at ground zero knew better. Water chemistry, filtration and treatment is not a new science. Yet the State of Michigan in its infinite wisdom could not get it right in its haste to save a buck. The entire mess can be and should be laid at the feet of a Republican Governor and his administration who endangered the health and welfare of it's citizens. No amount of spin can deflect the responsibility for this issue. ",

All the monies that have been diverted or denied will at some time cause many problems that will increase cost and also have huge sums that need to be used right away.  Of course how can we  make up for years of neglect when the failures begin?  Most likely many failures will occur concurrently. If congress and the states continue to neglect and abuse the infrastructure maintenance, then I believe we will have a decade or two before many of the problems will be repaired. This is a time bomb with out a timer.  The bombs will blow due to decay.",
