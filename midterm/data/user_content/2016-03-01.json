Trump has been throwing so many shoes on the floor since he started his campaign that everyone who could be alienated already has been. So, unless you can demonstrate that the electorate who will vote in the Republican primaries in the remaining states is somehow mostly comprised of the people Trump has offended, I don't see how he can't be the nominee.<br/><br/>(Nice reference to Bayesians, by the way, Justin.

If you believe the media is going to reward a candidate for sticking to his message with solutions think again, there is no room for that type of coverage when ratings are at hand. He has been a Senator since 2010, far more experience than the President that was in for less than 4 and before that, well nada.

I created seven; several failed; several were mediocre, and several were home runs. That's the way it works and makes possible non-creative people like you drawing a paycheck each week from people like Trump. It is extremely rare for an entrepreneur to go a career without some failures. In the end you add up your wins and losses and hope you come out well. Trump has come out exceptionally well and given tens of thousands their weekly paycheck. Unless you work for the government, you work for a company that was started by one or more entrepreneurs. ",

The society we have built is morally despicable, demented in a million ways. Anyone with any sentience at all can feel how rapacious and brutal it is, in matters both big and small. It destroys any sense of well-being and health at almost every turn of ordinary living. It has become intolerable. Putting an optimistic spin on it all is an exercise in contorted perception, and fools no one. His argument implodes on his pet phrase,\"at least this far,\" used repeatedly. Mr. Wenar, wake up! We've created a monstrous culture, and it is eating itself. From the historical record, it couldn't be clearer that we are a failed species. In the decades to come, we will get what we deserve. And the earth and its non-human survivors will be delivered from the scourge of the diseased animal, the ill-named homo sapiens.",

It's a loss of self identity by a very large, very ignorant and very lazy population which increasingly takes its direction from reality tv and avoids looking in the mirror for any reason other than to check  clothing and makeup.  And no matter how often they get burned, they scream for a savior every four years and turn against them thirty days after the inaugural ball.  It's quite horrifying, but for the first time in six decades, I no longer feel Americans have the will, the intellect or the spiritual core to save this country from a disaster on its way. But, as long as we have America's Got Talent...what the heck! Cue the theme from Titanic.",

				"commentBody": "When I was in elementary school, I was in an underfunded district in what was then one of the poorer states of the US. The curriculum was by and large stifling, the atmosphere misogynistic. An awkward, unathletic kid, I was bullied routinely.  If anyone had tried to test me on joy, I would have failed miserably -- or I would have received a placeholder grade in lieu of failure, as I did in one subset of the conduct marks.  At the very least, I would have found it patronizing. My prospects in life changed overnight when we moved to a different district, a more affluent and less rigid one in the same state. It is all well and good to preach about grit and to encourage perseverance, but don't forget that the most important factors are genuine opportunity for all learners, social and economic equity, support for diverse types of families,  and a commitment to ending discrimination.
