				"commentBody": "Note the two things in common and one thing different between Clinton and Petraeus:<br/><br/>Clinton didn't have criminal intent. So didn't Petraeus. This is the first thing in common.<br/><br/>As such, Petraeus couldn't be charged with intentionally criminal activities. He could only be charged with gross negligence. Here comes the second thing in common: Clinton committed, without doubt, gross negligence as well, only much worse.<br/><br/>The difference: Petraeus had been prosecuted, Clinton was not. <br/><br/>The unfairness is to seeming that one could hardly believe this is actually happening, and happening in the America. <br/><br/>Plus the time line:<br/>The meeting between the AG and Bill Clinton, which enables the AG conveniently to \"accept\" the FBI's recommendation not to prosecute Hillary Clinton; The FBI's interview with Hillary Clinton shortly  after the meeting and Comey's announcement of his recommendation shortly after the interview, hours before Obama campaigning with Hillary Clinton. <br/><br/>Have we been watching a real-time play of House of Cards?<br/><br/>Of course, as usual, there is no smoking gun. <br/><br/>It should be apparent now that there is a dark force who is so good at playing the rule of law and democracy to their favour. It's up to people to defend them. People are the last defence of them. If we don't act, then there will be no future for the rule of law, democracy and the America. ",

We are a nation of laws, where the courts are not used to intimidate or bully our politican foes into submission or defeat. We are a nation of laws, where our courts should not be used as agents of business to avoid payment of due debts. That is precisely why Trump should not be president.",

Apparently she doesn't like leaks and breaches when they expose HER or her cronies, but when her \"carelessness\" exposes classified information - that's a \"mistake.\"  She should call Snowden and forgive him his \"mistake\" and let him come back to the U.S. - hey! it's another potential voter.",

Neither investigation has found anything of substance and so the best they can do to try and get some political bang for their buck is to convince Comey, a republican, say some nasty things about her as he explains why they are dropping the investigation.<br/><br/>This non-issue perfectly encapsulates how dumbed down our politics and political reporting has become. No one apparently cares about the issues facing our country; or that the next Hitler or Hussein could be elected as our president (yes Trump just recently sent out antisemitic tweets from a white supremacist and tonight praised Saddam). And no one seems to care about the context (Colin Powell and Confoleeza Rice also had classified emails on their private servers) or proportionality (no one hurt, no laws broken)",
