				"commentBody": "From what I\u2019ve read American Muslims are trying hard to keep a low profile during this election. And who could blame them -- why would they wish to stir up bad feeling? After all, they number only about 1% of the U.S. population, hardly a number that is likely to make much of a difference in this election. Mr. Ali\u2019s spirited if rather fierce insistence that his fellow faithful are not \u201cPotato Head counterterrorism experts\u201d (whatever in heaven does that mean?) probably elicits sympathy, but asserting rights \u201cwith swagger and demanding to be treated with fairness\u201d sounds like a union get-together amply supplied with beer (yes, I recognize that beer probably isn\u2019t the best image to conjure).<br/><br/>An increase of more than 30% in Muslim voter registration since 2012? What does that amount to? 50,000 across America? I can appreciate swagger, but it\u2019s a little hard to take seriously numbers that might swing the election of county dead-animal-pickup commissioner, but not much else.<br/><br/>Khizr Khan is an interesting case. Trump certainly should have treated the family carefully, given a child who had died in the defense of America, but Mr. Kahn placed HIMSELF in the arena by attacking Trump in no uncertain terms \u2013 and certainly disrespectful ones \u2013 during the Democratic convention. What, Trump has no right to defend himself against such treatment?<br/><br/>All Americans should welcome American Muslim votes, whatever they be. But this op-ed takes political correctness about three galaxies too far.",
