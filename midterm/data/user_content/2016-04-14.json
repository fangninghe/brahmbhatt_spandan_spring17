Every cell tower getting faster 4g needs fiber to get it to the tower, all the companies Web Access and ip phones and the free WiFi all go on fibers that the equipment is still kept in a \"wireline\" Central office. It's a cloud to the public but the backbone of the Internet still travels through the wireline side. So Plain Old Telephone  (POTS) may be dying but the new equipment still needs to be repaired and wired or should I say Fibered......",

All this because of those damnable unions. So the average bloke who was not a member of the union bought the corporation's line and turned anti-union. And it never occurred to them that they were being scammed by the corporations.<br/>Unions used to be welcome into the community because they represented good paying jobs and benefits. Non-union companies scurried to be competitive with their pay packages.<br/>Now, when a union worker has a pay or benefit better than non-union workers, the first impulse is to side with the corporation. Soon, if people continue trying to destroy worker representation, we will all pay the price.<br/>Ask a non-union worker, Who represents you when you have been screwed over by your company?<br/>There really is class warfare in America, it's the lower middle class vs the middle class and it's being sponsored by politicians and corporations.",

Nanotechnology will be much further advanced.<br/><br/>However, the planning seems all based on what we can do today, including the cost.  In the meantime, some billionaires are concerned about climate change.  Others try to rig elections.  Would be great if we could get the latter to put their bucks into this boondoggle.<br/><br/>One-gram objects will not have the power to send us signals even if we grant that they will be able to record images and even study planets -- difficult when passing a star at 0.2c.  Enough power to send that signal would explode that small probe.  The plan seems to be to send so many of these probes that aiming them won't be an issue, but it will.<br/><br/>I love the ambition but not the practical aspects.  Instead of Mars One, we have Centauri One.<br/><br/>Let's work on Mars and our solar system a bit more.  Someone has been reading to many science fiction stories.  I'll stick to Mars Rhapsody.",
