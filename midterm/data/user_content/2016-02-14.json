				"commentBody": "If you want to find all HRCs faults, just read the WSJ, its columnists have an almost daily chore to find some evil deed she has done.<br/><br/>Not just some hints about Benghazi, or how much money the Clinton Foundation has raked in, but also ad hominums by the dozens. Kimberly Strassel has more than enough opprobrium to fill a dictionary regarding Hillary, and you Maureen are her enabler. <br/><br/>Well she is ambitious, and takes money from the banks, just like all of them except Sanders who calls all of them crooks and fraudsters. Now suppose you are just another hard working slug working in a large brokerage, trying to do the best you can for your client, who needs some retirement income, and, Sanders is calling you a crook, now what are you supposed to think of him. He lumps you in with the people that did help cause the economic crisis, all the while you are trying to keep you clients solvent, so who do you contribute to? <br/><br/>Even more specious Sander rails against the billionaires, so do a search and see who the most prominent are. Look at the fund mangers, and the hedge fund managers, whom people can not give money to fast enough. They are not Wall street. Look at the CEOs of the health insurance companies, their incomes are higher than those of the CEO of Wells Fargo, Eli Lilly, Merck, or Exxon. But they make easy targets, and are disliked because they are rich. <br/><br/>Sanders is playing to prejudice and envy too, he is not lilly white either. ",

In that decision, after stating that his guiding principal is that the Constitution was written to be understood by the average voter, Justice Scalia launches into the most convoluted arguments, defying fifth grade reading and comprehension skills, to argue that the \"prefatory clause\" has no influence on the intent and meaning of the entire Amendment, that it was, in essence, only a meaningless appendage.<br/><br/>Later in his opinion Justice Scalia engages in an equally convoluted set of arguments to show that \"Arms\" in the Amendment refers only to hand guns and possible long guns for personal protection, not all the weaponry needed by a State Militia to protect itself from Federal encroachment. Even Justice Scalia did not want tanks and machine guns in the hands of individuals.",

				"commentBody": "This is a scaremongering column designed to drive contributions to Kristoff's cronies in environmental groups. He insinuates that the chemical industry is responsible for today's childhood lead exposure.  He doesn't mention that lead based paints have been banned since 1978. He fails to point out that most of today's adults were exposed to levels of lead as children which would today be considered 'lead poisoning'.<br/><br/>Old lead based paints are the major source of childhood lead exposure. Removing old lead based paint is possible if somebody cares enough to pay for it. There is a risk that removal might liberate lead dust which can expose children to a higher level of lead than leaving the paint in place. <br/><br/>Kristoff calls for safety testing of chemicals. He is blissfully unaware that the Europeans have a very expensive and bureaucratic registration and testing scheme called REACH. If these tests ever find anything of interest, I'm sure news will reach the US. He also doesn't bother to note that lead, mercury and PCBs have been heavily restricted for some years. The threat here is from old equipment and buildings.<br/><br/>Kristoff mentions concerns with flame retardants used in furniture cushions. When furniture cushions burn they liberate various unpleasant things including cyanide. He doesn't mention that fires involving burning furniture used to kill quite a few people. He also won't be mentioning that tropical countries had fewer mosquitoes before environmentalists banned DDT.",

My question to Justice Scalia was worded sloppily, and I stood at the microphone as he pulled out a pocket copy of the Constitution of the United States (as amended), read me the key clauses (which have been amended), and disemboweled the question I had asked.<br/><br/>At a reception after his talk, I walked right up to him, shook his hand, and thanked him for the lesson. He said something about the importance of a lawyer using words precisely. I then worked up my courage and told him something HE had said in his public remarks that IMHO was misleading.<br/><br/>Close-minded? He listened exceedingly intently to my assertion that he had made a statement lacking in Constitutional or statutory basis. The sentence was barely out of my mouth when he said (twice), \"You're right.\"<br/><br/>Was he a man of strong views, sometimes expressed in an offensive manner? Sure. (He expressed a view offensively later in our chat.) Did he show much evolution in his thinking during his career on the bench? Probably not. Did he listen and respond to what others said? YES. And he did that in the spirit of intellectual (if not cultural) OPEN-mindedness.<br/><br/>I can think of some \"liberal\" Justices in our past who were equally (or more) close-minded. But nothing in Constitution or statute forbids close-mindedness.",

Houghton et al, 1990, estimate a natural input and output exchange of 150 gigatons per year. <br/><br/>Houghton also estimates 10 gigatons of carbon emitted annually into the atmosphere by human activities (ref Houghton, R.A. 2008, Carbon dioxide Inf. Anal. Cent., Oak Ridge Natl. Lab, Oak Ridge, Tenn) <br/><br/>10/150 = 6.6%. So Houghton thinks 94% of CO2 flux is naturally occurring. \"Far in excess\" seems to fit pretty well. <br/><br/>Revelle &amp; Seuss (Tellus, vol. 9, pp 18-27, 2957) calculated that the amount of atmospheric CO2 due to human activities was 1.2 to 1.7% of the total.<br/><br/>Jaworowski, Z (EIR Science, Mar 16, 2007, pp38-53) reckons that \"97%  of the total annual emission of CO2 into the atmosphere comes from natural emissions of the land and sea: human beings add a mere 3%. this man-made 3% of CO2 emissions is responsible for a tiny fraction of the total greenhouse effect, probably close to 0.12%\"<br/><br/>So CO2 is indeed produced by natural sources \"far in excess\" of man-made sources. When you assert the opposite and say \"I'm sorry I don't have figures available but that is roughly true.\" let me remind you of the old saying, <br/><br/>\"Those who cannot deal with numbers are doomed to talk nonsense.\"<br/><br/>You refer to the \"rise in CO2 content in the atmosphere\", which is quite a different thing. Implies that 280 ppm CO2 is ideal, which it is not.",

				"commentBody": "It is unsurprising that The Times offers up some conventional praise of the impact (largely negative) of Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.  However, it defies logic to say he was either originaliist or a strict constructionalist.  If you are parsing language then the stated purpose in the Second Amendment was ignored and the intent of the Framers, against standing armies, was disregarded.  If you read references to people or persons in the Constitution, as an originalist or strict constructionalist they can only be read as meaning actual living persons and not artificial legal fictions.  If you embrace states rights then there are no federal election laws and no federal power to interfere in the conduct of state-managed elections.  In all these areas, and others, Antonin Scalia failed as a judge in that he reached his result not based on the law or precedent but on the outcome he sought.  He cheapened the Court and the judicial process and that's he legacy, excluding the perhaps unintended ones of destruction, war, death, and the impoverishment of the Nation.",

				"commentBody": "W:<br/><br/>I voted for you twice. Hope you appreciate it.<br/><br/>Obama could only pass as a liberal Republican to a real liberal, particularly on defense matters. However, since his re-election he's veered significantly to the left.<br/><br/>The intelligent thing for him to do would be to SECRETLY invite Ryan and McConnell to the Oval Office or perhaps better to Camp David, ply them with drinks and klatch honestly with them about which nominee would allow McConnell to gather enough support for a confirmation. As I've written repeatedly today in comments, my first suggestion would be Posner.<br/><br/>There's no real motivation for McConnell to be obstreperous: one way or another we have a new president at Noon, 20 Jan., 2017. May as well unite on this issue if we can.  ",
