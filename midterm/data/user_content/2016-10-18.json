The point that seems to have escaped you is if an athlete is famous and well-paid because of a skill, they should only be penalized financially if their skill diminishes. If the pay is not based on politics the athlete should be free to exercise free speech without the label of grandstanding. To conflate athletic performance with patriotism is frankly Trumpish.

				"commentBody": "Globalization is skewing everything....outsourcing, insourcing.....whatever you want to call it.  Then theres's automation.  No job security whatsoever.  Assets are being bid up because people in foreign markets who made money via globalization are transferring money here, bidding up real estate and other assets.  I'd like to see a study done on the equity markets to see how many companies are currently listed on the U.S. exchanges, and how that's changed over the last 20-30 years.  How many more people are investing than in the past to bid up prices/market caps and how have P/E ratios may have changed.  I don't follow the markets and individual companies as closely as I used to when I was an analyst, but my understanding is now we are also seeing a lot more evidence than in the past of companies appearing to have EPS growth that is manipulated by share buybacks or some other factor, which is deceiving because it isn't growing a company organically.  With a low interest rate environment, money is naturally going to flow into equity markets, private equity, alternative asset classes, foreign markets (although risky - lot of countries slowing down and not as transparent as need be without following GAAP).  Lots of hedge funds closing shop.  Sign of the times.  Need to come up with a more sustainable economic model.  If you saw \"Madoff,\" starring Richard Dreyfuss.  When he gets arrested for his Ponzi scheme, he comments that our whole system is a Ponzi scheme, and he's right.",

You identify with the good and you fight against the evil, and this is a religious system which belongs to the Near East, following Zarathustra\u2019s time. It\u2019s in the biblical tradition, all the way, in Christianity and in Islam as well. This business of not being with nature, and we speak with sort of derogation of \u201cthe nature religions.\u201d You see, with that fall in the garden [of Eden], nature was regarded as corrupt. There\u2019s a myth for you that corrupts the whole world for us. And every spontaneous act is sinful, because nature is corrupt and has to be corrected, must not be yielded to. You get a totally different civilization, a totally different way of living according to your myth as to whether nature is fallen or whether nature is itself a manifestation of divinity, and the spirit being the revelation of the divinity that\u2019s inherent in nature.'<br/><br/><a href=\"http://billmoyers.com/content/ep-2-joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-the-message-of-the-myth/\" title=\"http://billmoyers.com/content/ep-2-joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-the-message-of-the-myth/\" target=\"_blank\">http://billmoyers.com/content/ep-2-joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth...</a>",

				"commentBody": "If you examine the leaked emails and carefully examine my premise, you too may come to the conclusion that Hillary Clinton is not much of a feminist. Having read a few of the emails where she discusses China, they seem reasonable enough. She talks about balance of power, etc.<br/><br/>But at her core, she is a loyal servant of power. And apparently an effective one. What does that mean? It means that primarily, she does the bidding of those in power\u2014older wealthy capitalistic,white men. Men on a power trip that doesn\u2019t consider anything but leveraging their power over the world and ignoring most basic human considerations. Men of the New American Century, and also Democrats like Obama and Kerry.<br/><br/>Is this what feminists are admiring in her? I\u2019d like to hear answers to my question.",
