				"commentBody": "The idea that meat and fat are nourishing is as old as meat and fat. We have been omnivores since before we were even human. Dr. Hu has never found a correlation without assuming that it was the same as causation, and he ignores the numerous recent meta-analyses which have found no connection between sat fat or meat consumption and chronic diseases.<br/><br/>Smoking is a straw-man argument. Lung cancer was rare before smoking, and the increased risk from smoking is 15-20x not smoking, and we are able to clearly rule out other factors. The supposed increased risk of any diseases from red meat consumption is less than 2x, and there are literally dozens of confounding factors. Same for eating whole grains -- nutritionally inessential, the supposed benefits are small, and there are dozens of confounding factors. <br/><br/>Good quality meats, fish, eggs, and dairy _are_ whole real foods, nutrient dense and satiating to the appetite. Most people _improve_ health when they eat more naturally fatty foods, and this has been demonstrated with numerous controlled trials with human subjects.",

				"commentBody": "In another nightmarish year, 1968, there was no sunnier politician than Hubert Humphrey, the presidential nominee who was trying to make it three terms in a row for the Democrats with his \"politics of joy.\" But that didn't jibe especially well with what Americans were experiencing in their daily lives.<br/><br/>As it turned out, the highly disreputable Richard Nixon, in a three-way race, gained 43.4 percent of popular vote and 301 in the Electoral College, and if George Wallace's totals are added to the rejection-of-the-status-quo demographic, the figures were 56.9 percent and 347. So, if nothing else, an angry, volatile electorate is unpredictable, even after having initially bought into Hope and Change or a historical equivalent, the New Frontier.<br/><br/>So given that Mrs. Clinton's poll numbers for honesty and trustworthiness are so deeply underwater -- with two-thirds of likely voters saying she is neither -- her newfound smiley face could be a much tougher sell for a potential Clinton 45 than the Democratic stage managers think. All the more so since so many working (or formerly working) people are still riddled with shrapnel from the economic time bombs set by Clinton 42.<br/><br/>Credibility is the coin of the realm, and Mrs. Clinton's best selling point is who she's running against. The key would seem to be overcoming, at long last, her problem with authenticity. As in pulling off what was best defined by, among others, George Burns: \"Sincerity -- if you can fake that, you've got it made.\"",

				"commentBody": "I think the right/wrong track is being driven primarily by income inequality.  Americans take fewer vacations, few have retirement pensions, adequate maternity leave or even raises.  We seem to be working harder for less.  And that is for the fortunate ones who have employment.  So there is a feeling of marching in place.  After a while, it simply wears you down.  Unfortunately, the change that this requires will be more than just an increase in the minimum wage, or a new factory opening.  It will take a change of behavior on the part of businesses to stop treating their employees as disposable widgets.  And that will probably require a carrot/stock approach and laws and taxes that will help push companies towards responsible corporate behavior. Donald Trump will do absolutely nothing to solve this problem.  In fact, his irresponsible tax proposals will make it worse.  I'm not certain Hillary Clinton can solve the problem, but I do believe she will try.  And that's a start.",

I trust her as much or more than any male president thus far in my lifetime and I'm almost 70... Name one as \"Trustworthy\" with the exception of Obama and perhaps Truman?

There is no denying that women do have a role outside the home.  <br/><br/>I do have a few critiques of your argument and the Women's Movement.  Is there anything positive about males or having males in positions of power? And if so what? The trend in this moment is to denigrate any male behavior or accomplishment  Denying the contributions of males and their actions in society turns many off, and is patently false.  Similarly, the current strain of Feminism elevates being female as the pinnacle of human existence, that they are the core source of good in the world, and any criticism of a woman (the right kind of course) is sexist.  This too is ridiculous, women are individuals with their own motivations, feelings, and tendencies to be good/ evil. <br/><br/>You argue that when females win, males win and give a limited number of specific scenarios.  I challenge you to justify how the approximately Undergraduate 40% male to 60% female ratio benefits males.  This is an disparity and would not be ethically okay either if it was the reverse.  We are facing an crisis in the male population: 5x suicide ratio; under education; grossly overrepresentation in the prison system; etc.  Are we brave enough to directly allocate resources to improve men or will we only improve the lot of women claiming it benefits males indirectly?

She refers to \"coal country.\"  Where was she when the Appalachian mountain range was being dismantled, destroyed, by \"coal country\" corporatists and loyal Democrats? It's called \"mountain top removal\" mining and, like frack sand mining, is a vile Earth-destroying activity that went virtually un-remarked by Democrats in power, including West Virginia Democrat Rockefeller! Once upon a time she (and Obama) were from Illinois. If either of them ever visited and toured they might notice the immense and growing sand mining going on in northern Illinois. Michigan is being fracked and sand-mined so extensively it is increasing looking like moonscape; that's \"Pure Michigan\" and Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, etc. etc. Hillary and Bill are not environmentalists. Trump will be worse. Who speaks for Earth when the likely winner supports fracking and frack sand mining and environmental destruction? Then there's Dick Cheney and the absolute evil secret deal he made to sell out the Clean Water Act to support hydraulic fracturing and Halliburton and we have BP in the Gulf and the whole Gulf and environs so horribly damaged. Has anybody changed that rotten deal? Is the Gulf all \"Pure Gulf\" now? Did Obama reverse Cheney's evil? ",

For a fourth 3-pointer I had a slim hope - paper thin, really - that one who acculturates might be an acculturator but...nuh-uh. Foreign words are always tricky, I think acceptance as an answer depends on how widespread the usage, and even that can be questionable. Rucola (Italian for \"arugula\") didn't make the cut in the Times' answer key and I'm ok with that. In earlier Bees, rigatoni, cannelloni, and celli (plural of cello) did make the cut, and I agree with that. Similarly, coloratura describes some of the most famous sopranos of all time...Beverly Sills, Kathleen Battle, Maria Callas, Joan Sutherland, et. al., and one need not be a classical music buff to have had reasonable opportunity to encounter that word...although I did take special pleasure when I found it in the Bee.",

That this should be a \"turn off\" to you is exactly why it is important to recognize her, and is also very telling about your own possible misogyny. One of her main projects has been equal pay for women. It is a big deal. But not her only one.",

				"commentBody": "I think that Mr. Bruni missed an important message in the DNC convention: \"together WE can.\" The world is not good. While America is one of the best positioned countries, we are challenged by shaky economies everywhere and dangerous geopolitical flash points all over the world. At home, while many states and most cities are doing well, there are pockets of deep depression fueling the rise of Trump. Restoring economic justice and personal dignity through new employment opportunities will help in the long run. Solving all these problems are formidable challenges. Mrs. Clinton and her team will not be able to tackle all these from Washington. The convention is a call for action and a call for sacrifice for ordinary citizens. For too long, our politicians ask too little of us. Only by doing more and doing better for your community and country, that we can tackle this challenge together. The optimism in the DNC convention comes from the faith that ordinary people will step up and help build a better world. I will put my faith in the American people over Trump any day and I hope many others will see the same optimism. ",

				"commentBody": "Sure trade is complicated and lots of hand waving arguments can be made but the end result is clear.  The US is losing its industry and turning itself into a third world country both in the sense of being less developed and in the sense that it is turning into a two class society ruled by an elite.  <br/><br/>The fundamental argument behind free trade is \"the principle of comparitive advantage\" which seemed to work when we were trading with developed countries like the EU and small developing countries.  China is so large that it can suck all the investment capital and destroy our industries.<br/><br/>The American colonies declared their independence from Britain in part to get rid of the trade relationships that Britain imposed on its colonies.  Comparing the US to other former colonies like India should give some idea of the difference produced by being subjected to mercantilist trade relationships.",
