				"commentBody": "Our family dentist did some orthodontia as well.  He put braces on his top teeth to correct a space between the front ones and a \"bucktooth\" look, but left the slightly crooked bottom ones alone, as our son requested.  We left it up to him and that's what he wanted.  His teeth look great.<br/><br/>With our daughter, though, there was no question she would need braces.  She had snaggleteeth, and several were congenitally missing.  Her orthodontia took years longer than her brother's, but achieved a very good outcome as well.  Recently she got an implant for her missing front tooth, and now her teeth are just right.",

The lights went out and hundreds if not more protesters were killed that night and it was all cleaned up by dawn. This will NEVER be forgotten and is why the government still rounds up anybody who was involved, even the 80 year old mothers who are \"causing trouble\" by visiting their brave children's grave sites this time of year, who were gunned down because they wanted better government.

Security Counsel and the mainland was ignored until that seems to be odd. Come Nixon and that changed. The USA today is aboard the One Country Two Systems that Taiwan and the mainland hold to and what it means is Taiwan can go its way \u2013 so long as independence is not an issue. Sound like HK until 2049? All these things will evolve, hopefully peacefully but sword rattling, now on the upswing in D.C. circles is going to be an unhappy ending unless sane leadership reappears. On the flag, watch the entry of Taiwan team at the Olympics  if you can find it.",

Yes, they are but the average citizen is happy enough with their lot in life and a revolution is not on the horizon.  Besides, the prospect of a completely democratic China is outrageous.  I can only imagine the candidates who would emerge and the horse trading that would ensue.  Elections, not Xi's current crackdown, will be the end of China.",

Chinese manufacturers can sell whatever they want in the free market. They set up a paper trail that is so convoluted that, when something goes wrong, the manufacturers can't be tracked down. As a result, the manufacturers have no financial incentive to follow standard safety procedures, and people have died as a result of improperly prepared Chinese heparin. <br/><br/>Or for a closer example, compounding pharmacies in the US are not regulated by the federal government, and after cutbacks in funding for state health departments, they're not regulated by the states either. As a result, we had the same kind of problems that the Chinese did, with for example contamination of injected steroids by the New England Compounding Center which killed at least 60 people <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Compounding_Center_meningitis_outbreak\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Compounding_Center_meningitis_outbreak\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Compounding_Center_meningitis_...</a><br/><br/>We started out with the free market. It didn't work. <br/><br/>Regulations actually create jobs -- for FDA inspectors, who make sure that drugs are manufactured safely according to standard procedures. That's as important as the job of the guy who fills up vials with drugs -- contaminated drugs, in the case of the New England Compounding Center and Chinese heparin manufacturers. ",
