I enjoyed the movie and the discussion it has engendered (pun intended).<br/><a href=\"http://www.infowars.com/mad-max-the-feminist-warrior-2/\" title=\"http://www.infowars.com/mad-max-the-feminist-warrior-2/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.infowars.com/mad-max-the-feminist-warrior-2/</a>",

Individuals or a couple who have a house in a good location, kids in god schools, community connections, etc. don't need the disruption of a move.<br/>Conversely, many folks with fewer in-demand skills, or manufacturing and service industry background cannot move in search of better opportunities, mainly because of mortgages and health care.<br/>- govts could lower tax rates substantially and remove mortgage interest deductions, which would make home ownership more fluid and rational<br/>- govts could untie health insurance from employers/jobs, which would improve mobility, especially for the highly skilled and entrepreneurs.

I have 5 labradors that shed like..labradors...and I'm not sure if uber would be super happy with me letting them in the car from a recent day at the beach or lake. Other than that, it's just nice having something that is mine. I think when autonomous cars become available for individual ownership the individual niceties of that car being your personal property that ownership will remain. For example, it's nice being able to leave my boots in the car; it's nice being able to leave my laptop in the car; etc etc. That said, I already use Lyft and Uber for when I'm heading out to drink; It'll be nice when I have my autonomous car with my own blanket and pillows in the back for napping while driving.",

Many of the greatest minds of our time who could lead us are instead in industry, science, and academia. They will not allow their lives to be twisted apart, every fiber scrutinized, nor will they bear the lies and mudslinging of politics today. As a result, the American people have lost these great leaders and instead end up with charlatans and fools, those who can buy their way to the top, narcissistic billionaires who have no vision of America's true potential, and candidates who have no knowledge of domestic or foreign affairs, including the delicate geopolitics of the world.

				"commentBody": "The Democrats need to overhaul their candidate selection for President by eliminating the undemocratic caucus system.  In Nebraska, Sanders got 15 delegates to Clinton's 10 by winning the caucus by 57% to 43%.  When they had a non-binding primary election Nebraska, where many times more people voted, Clinton won by 57% to 43%.  In Washington, Sanders won the caucuses, Sanders won 73% to 27% and was awarded 25 delegates to Clinton's 9.  Tonight there is a non-binding primary in Washington. Last report with 75% of the vote in (with 30 times more than the votes of the caucuses), Hillary was ahead 54% to 46%.  Interesting what happens when you have a real election.  If the caucuses had been primaries, Hillary would be about 31 more pledged delegates ahead of Sanders than she is.  How many more delegates would she be ahead if all the caucuses had been actual primary elections? <br/><br/>Interestingly, it's hard to even find the results for these two non-binding primaries in Nebraska and Washington.  MSNBC has reported them on air, but the Times doesn't seem to be reporting either of them.  (If I were a Sanders supporter and the facts were reversed, I'd say it's a conspiracy to cover up how undemocratic the DNC is and how my candidate is being cheated.)  I know Bernie thinks he needs to change the Democratic primary rules, but I haven't hear him whining about how undemocratic the caucuses are.",

In the UK, no outlier such as Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders could run for office undercover; the political parties in the UK, and across Europe are far more disciplined and organized than their weak American counterparts. The party system in the United States lacks the true discipline and principles of our European counterparts, with the result being that an outsider like Donald Trump can capture the nomination of a party that despises him!

He may have no aptitude for it. It will take years, and cost him a lot in lost wages and loans for tuition. At the end, he is now a 59 year old ex-autoworker.....trying to compete with 24 year olds in a shrinking job market (programming can be done very nicely in India, for $10K a year).<br/><br/>The number of \"growing\" fields is surprisingly small and most of these require advanced degrees, meaning tens of thousands in cost. By the time you GET the degree, the marker has moved and suddenly the field you studied and spent your life savings to learn....isn't \"hot\" anymore.<br/><br/>I have a pretty bad feeling about what will happen, in 2020-2025 to all those freshly minted \"STEM\" graduates....all hitting the market place at the same time.

Each grouping of strngs of n bit pairs thus contains  n - 1 binary numbers (the 2-bit strings) in that group.  <br/><br/>In the above example the number list count 10 = 4*5/2 is also the sum of the first 4 sets of consecutive 2-bit integers, and each member of the last group is a string 5 bits long.<br/><br/>Since the 50th number is asked for, and the cumulative number of bit strings (as each group sequence is formed) goes like 1 3 6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55, the 50th number must therefore be an 11 bit string.  The 46th string is 10000000001, so the 50th is 100000010000 which is 2^11 + 2^5 = 2080.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the other answers yet so I'll put this out then look.  :-)",
