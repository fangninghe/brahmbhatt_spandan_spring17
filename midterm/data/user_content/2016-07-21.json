				"commentBody": "Ricardo Ech,<br/><br/>Thanks for your helpful comments.  I will try to correct and clarify the ideas:<br/><br/>Assume k &gt; 3, and n is an odd prime, and A, B, C, and D are any four consecutive vertices of P.  We know that (AB)^2 and (BC)^2 and (CD)^2 are integers divisible by n.  Also, because all vertices have integral coordinates, the squares of all side lengths and diagonal lengths are integers.<br/><br/>By Ptolemy\u2019s theorem, (AB)(CD) + (BC)(AD) = (AC)(BD).  We square both sides to get:<br/><br/> [(AB)^2 ][(CD)^2]+ 2(AB)(CD)(BC)(AD) + [(BC)^2][(AD)^2]<br/> = [(AC)^2][(BD)^2]<br/><br/>The term 2(AB)(CD)(BC)(AD) is an integer, since all other terms in the equation are integers.<br/><br/>Note that [(AB)^2 ][(CD)^2] and [(BC)^2][(AD)^2] are both divisible by n.  Furthermore, 2(AB)(CD)(BC)(AD) is divisible by n, since it is an integer whose square must be divisible by n^3.<br/><br/>We see that [(AC)^2][(BD)^2] is divisible by n, as it is a sum of integers all divisible by n.  So since (AC)^2 and (BD)^2 are integers whose product is divisible by n, polygon P must have a diagonal (either AC or BD) the square of whose length is divisible by n.  This completes the induction on k for the case with n being an odd prime.<br/><br/>We next have to generalize the proof to allow n to be a power of an odd prime.",

Surprised that Trump was clearing the field of everyone but him  --  and especially of Bush  --  Cruz started to take 2016 seriously. Once it was clear he wouldn't get the nomination, he was faced with having to decide if Trump might win. Having decided Trump was likely to lose, Cruz went back to his original plan of preparing for 2020. To do that at this point, he had to maintain his credibility with his supporters, all of whom loathe Trump. Thus it became an easy call not to support Trump and to do it in a very public way with maximum publicity. Not only does Cruz thus embed himself rock solid with his supporters, but he gets points from much of the Republican establishment which, though they do not like him, will appreciate what Cruz did, even if their public cheers are muted.<br/><br/>Again, this was the first major gauntlet thrown down in the Republican presidential fight in 2020.",

If Cruz is contemplating 2020 he must first contemplate the fact that his support base is even smaller than Trumps', much smaller. When will the GOP wake up and realize that their \"base\"is a small, shrinking population of fringe religious, firearm toting, racist, white southerners. The independents who helped them get elected in 2000 and 2004 have been driven out because they are not ideologically pure and/or apostate. Jesus Christ certainly wouldn't pass their litmus test. Instead of trying to convince a wider audience of the wisdom of their policies, they each repeat the same scripted anti-Hillary diatribe that they've been droning on with for years. This party is finished on the national stage. If the courts would declare gerrymandering unconstitutional then their hold on the state houses might crumble too. Even so, red states are turning purple and purple states blue faster with every anti-Hispanic speech the republicans make.",
