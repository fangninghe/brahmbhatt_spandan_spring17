				"commentBody": "No one appears to be immune from the problem but those with graduate degrees in the sciences seem to be less affected than others. A four year college degree doesn\u2019t seem to provide that much 'immunization' as engineers are often the 'creation scientists', and some other degrees don\u2019t appear to provide the ability to readily discern fact from fiction.  <br/><br/>Don't forget that about a quarter of Democrat believe in creationism, as do about a quarter of people with college degrees. Democrats are much more likely to want to shut down nuclear power in site of the fact that it has actually saved millions of lives due to less coal being burned. Democrats have pushed for assault weapon bans in spite of the fact that it would have an unmeasurable impact on the national homicide rate, and worse yet while ignoring the primary contributors to firearm homicides in the country.  When values and beliefs are embraced one is at risk as they tend to change slowly, if at all. ",

I was going to suggest a nice little California Gold Country town with an Irish pub for your retirement (Murphy's). Instead, a miracle happened and you are now the only Times journalist who Trump is likely to speak to for the next four years. That makes you the 'It' girl. <br/><br/>There are going to be some challenges for you. You won't have the Clintons to kick around anymore, which will rob you of at least 50% of your material. You are going to have to come up with a really good grovel to work your way back into Trump's good graces. And at your age you probably don't have to worry about Trump kissing you or trying to grab your crotch, but you never know. Still, it certainly beats the alternative.<br/><br/>Enjoy the state dinners!",

There is too much room for the financial and political elite to increase suffering, and too much room left to pillage the middle class.<br/><br/>1.  Cut the work week to 30 hours.  Immediately, there will be many more people employed.  Big business and their gambler-shareholders won't like it because it raises the expense side.<br/>2.  Only allow small and medium size businesses to exist.  For example, outlaw businesses over 5000 employees, including contractors.  This will create competition, and new businesses as big business is broken up.<br/>3.  Ditch the concept of publicly owned companies, and the equity market.  Require those who own a business to work for the business.  If a business needs capital, let them get a loan or float a bond.<br/>4.  Encourage worker owned cooperatives as the norm.  There are variations on how these can be set up.<br/>5.  For any situation where an exception supports the PUBLIC interest, the business will be highly regulated - FOR the PUBLIC interest.",

				"commentBody": "Folks, there is absolutely nothing wrong with Carrier seeking a cheaper labor market. This is called free market capitalism, and every worker in the US believes in it and hates all forms of bureaucratic regulations. Every business owner or manager tries to maximize profits. You do that one of two ways; 1) sell as much of your product as you can for as much money as the market will bear, and 2) keep expenses as low as possible that will still allow you to accomplish 1). The biggest expense for most businesses is labor. That means you squeeze labor costs to as close to zero as you can. Why would you not move your factory with a labor force that earns $25/hour to another country with a labor force that earns $10/day, no union, no overtime, and no safety regulations? Who cares if you spent 17 years on their factory floor? This is a capitalist enterprise, not your family! The only chance a working man or woman has in this race to the bottom is to be in an industry that cannot cannot export it's labor force, but the trend is moving the other way. Otherwise help can only come from regulation. Mr. Trump has mentioned a couple, and if he is able to upend the wishes of his Republican congress with regulations that protect American jobs, he'll be a real American hero to American workers. Otherwise, you need to either learn to live on $10/DAY, or learn a new trade through the excellent system of vocational education in our school system. Oops.",

We value free markets, yet we also insist on low prices at Wal-Mart. Guess what? Those low prices come with a cost, and it's being paid by lost jobs in manufacturing. Nothing TRUMP does will change these facts. We don't get to have high wages, healthcare AND low prices!<br/><br/>We spent decades churning out MBA's who sacrificed good-paying American jobs for shareholder returns.

Look at what FDR did with the Works Profgress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps.  The CCC built Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National Park.  Even state parks have CCC and WPA structures and products that have stood the test of time.  What are we doing now?  Decimating our national parks system and ignoring our failing infrastructure.  Putting money into public transportation such as rail service would also stimulate jobs.  For all of these efforts there should be a requirement that materials used must be manufactured in the US-steel, cement, rails, rail cars, etc.<br/><br/>Trump will not do this.  HRC was not planning to do this.  Obama did not really push this.  If we do not use government to leverage jobs creation, we will continue to lose the battle.  My last Nissan was made in Tennessee.  My current Nissan was made in Mexico.  There probably is no way to reverse the<br/>that trend but there is a way to create a trend at home.  No politician has tried. None will.  ",

				"commentBody": "Mr. Trump cannot save or bring back jobs to America. Reasons?<br/>There are many:<br/><br/>1) No president can create jobs; they can encourage companies to create jobs via lending &amp; tax/fiscal policy. Or scare them to stay.<br/><br/>2) America left the industrial age. Our \"information economy\" now consists of Information Svcs (computing, data warehousing, analytics, AI, etc.) and Services (hospitality, healthcare, legal, financial, consulting, etc.) jobs.<br/><br/>3) Blue-collar workers offer precise physical skills to industry; however their work is performed easily for less-cost by robots &amp; automated systems. The overall cost of a blue-collar worker, over many years, is more expensive than a robot's costs. When we consider worker productivity, aging/illnesses, errors, cost of periodic retraining, salary &amp; benefits, retirement costs, management/overhead, etc... a robot is much cheaper, reliable, consistent, easily reprogrammable, upgradable, and deductible (taxes, amortization). No comparison, blue-collar workers have lost this race.<br/><br/>4) Low-skilled U.S. workers are more expensive than comparable low-skilled workers in developing nations. Workers performing food service, non-precise mfg/assembly, even housekeeping/custodial work can be replaced through H1B labor at much cheaper labor costs. Jobs can also be outsourced to countries in South America, Asia, and former Soviet nations, with African workers waiting to take-up future slack. For decades, U.S. low-skilled workers will remain noncompetitive.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0",

							"commentBody": "The government should start a jobs program to fix our infrastructure. This would stimulate job growth directly for workers repairing infrastructure but also in industries supporting the effort-steel, cement, etc.BUT, materials used in the program must be required to be made in the US. Democrats could have done this. They had a majority the first two years of Obama's administration. I respect Obama, understand GOP obstruction but observe that he is not a good negotiator. He starts with a compromise, not his original position. Republucans bargain him down. He also governs from the middle and is not a progressive.<br/><br/>HRC is not a progressive, either. She ignored people like those in the story and only began to pay lip service to job creation in response to Trump's efforts. Comey's two letters lessened her inroads after the Trump tapes. She and her staff blame Comey for her loss. That is not the whole story. Other news sources report that Bill Clinton recommended she campaign among working class folks like these. His suggestion was supposedly overruled by her staff who felt she could reproduce the coalition that Obama drew on--Latinos and African Americans. Not so. Hispanics went for Trump at a greater rate than for Romney in 2012. Blacks did not vote for her in the same numbers as for Obama. She, her staff, and Comey contributed to her loss. Trump won fairly. Some protestors say they did not vote or voted third party. Why? Democrats are partially to blame for this abomination.",

Progressive thinkers do not literally believe the Onion, or Stephen Colbert, et. al. But many in the right-wing faction, the people who support Trump, apparently do believe that Obama was born in Kenya, that Hillary Clinton is a criminal who must be locked up. <br/><br/>Satire requires a certain degree of basic information and mental sophistication and engenders a second layer of humor when people without those qualities \"don't catch on.\"  Lies of the alt/right are never misunderstood by fans of the Onion, Colbert, Stewart, Fey, and our other currently practicing American satirists.<br/><br/>Satire has long been an American tradition, with an illustrious string of practitioners from Josh Billings through George Ade to Jack Benny and beyond. And America has been an enthusiastic consumer of British satire, too. I'll bet if Monty Python were still in business, the alt/right would have a field day of outrage at the horrors it reveals. Same goes for Jonathan Swift.<br/><br/>No, something has changed. The alt/right has an information gap and a malfunctioning funny bone.",

Their question was answered over and over.<br/><br/>I agree you don't have to read Deb's article or previous comments, but isn't it logical to if you're looking for answers?  Especially when the article has a link specifically for folks who don't understand.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is that you should be able to ask away and not feel belittled, even if that is the last thing anyone here intends.",

				"commentBody": "We are in the danger of freedom of speech. The mainstream media have been careful that they should not send readers wrong information or expressions which may despise minorities. They examine information carefully before they publish or broadcast.<br/>But some alt-right news websites display a lot of false information intentionally mixing some true information. The net is flooded with fake information. Quite a few people cannot distinguish between true information and false one. Though some one sends false information damaging others, no one takes responsibility.<br/>The mainstream media should not ignore the false information displayed on some websites and accuse them of lying. This problem should be solved in the press. If fake information senders do not stop their bad behaviors until prosecutors investigate, it will be a big damage to freedom of speech. ",

But I'd like to add that over a period of about a year, the NYT's coverage morphed from denial to false equivalency to ridicule before the frenzy of strident advocacy.<br/><br/>And what nearly all the media -- whether mainstream or conspiratorial -- seems to have missed is that it is likely that (1) a majority of the people who voted Republican are not uneducated fools, as so many liberals are now howling, and (2) they knew Trump is a flaming idiot, but voted for him anyway.<br/><br/>Stupidity didn't inform their choice; desperation did.  Four more years of a Democratic administration would have meant four more years of self-congratulating, identity-politics driven bureaucrats more concerned with sexual identity than unemployed coal miners or auto workers.  It ain't rocket science.  Do the demographics.",
