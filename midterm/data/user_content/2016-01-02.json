				"commentBody": "The first four of tonight's comments (being the only ones when I began writing this) were basically fact checks. That's a good thing, of course. I often do the same myself. But it certainly starts the night's read on a rather \"downer\" tone. I for one enjoyed the puzzle, and I don't mind saying so. <br/><br/>Yes, we have T. J. MAXX around this part of the country, though I'm not conversant with its wares nor Kohl's. But I've heard of them both, so I'll assume they are comparable enough for the cluing.<br/><br/>Here's my \"downer\": I'm a bit surprised to see ARIE, Italian plural form for \"arias,\" clued by a Viennese operetta (originally written in German, though I've often heard it sung in English). Seems a little odd. I've never heard an English-speaking participant in operas, operettas, oratorios, or cantatas refer to them in the plural as anything but \"arias.\" Maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>For 27D, how about this: \"He was switched on by Carlos in 1969.\" (Maybe a bit obscure anymore.)<br/><br/>Let me offer this bit of fluff in which Martyn Green sings \"If You Give Me Your Attention\" (from G&amp;S's Princess Ida):<br/><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gT_sfwlSxE8\" title=\"https://youtu.be/gT_sfwlSxE8\" target=\"_blank\">https://youtu.be/gT_sfwlSxE8</a>",

It consisted of Moog synthesizer realizations of J. S. Bach selections, and became a runaway sensation. A sort of precursor to \"Hooked On Classics\" without the pop rhythm section.<br/><br/>I was going to post a clip, but YouTube is so infested with knock-offs and home-grown tributes masquerading as \"Switched-On Bach\" and everything related, it's impossible to find Carlos's original recordings.<br/><br/>As for MTFT, I agree. I always enjoy Tobin's remarks. The person I referenced in particular wasn't him, but I'll leave it at that as I've already ventured all to far into personal sniping, which I shouldn't be doing. Sorry.",

				"commentBody": "In my limited experience with cancer, the problems with cancer treatment aren't a lack of drugs for early-stage cancers (which are generally get first-line standard treatment based upon cancers of that particular subtype). <br/><br/>A real issue is that there is insufficient priority placed upon rapid diagnosis and treatment. Britain instituted a \"Two Week Rule\" regarding suspected melanoma, where suspected melanoma are subjected to a full and complete excision, most usually immediately, but always by this rule, within two weeks of detection. Studies performed in Britain as well as those written up by the NIH have demonstrated 5-year survival rates that have cut the percentage of fatalities in half because of this rule. (82% survival compared to 62%) Nevertheless, even though Britain has made this the standard of care in 2000, fifteen years later, the US has failed to take this rule up.<br/><br/>I recently had a loved one found with a suspected melanoma, and we as a family struggled with the US medical system to get it treated according to this British standard of care. It was impossible, because doctors don't give priority to suspected melanoma, so we waited for treatment behind patients that had more definitive diagnoses, and because the suspected melanoma was diagnosed with a punch biopsy that provides insufficient information for precise staging based upon Breslow thickness and fails to remove tumors that may still metastasize while waiting for definitive treatment.",

When people believe their best chance of getting ahead is one of those two options, something is very badly wrong.",

				"commentBody": "The privacy puzzle has three different aspects<br/>- what the device actually does<br/>- what the device can do<br/>- what the public perceives the device as doing / being able to do.<br/>The public perception is hard to control, especially because it's very difficult to get people to trust your assertions that what the device actually does is much much less than what it could be doing, and as with most technology, what it actually does probably is less than what many of the users would like it to be able to do.<br/>Is there a network connection?  Then it could be uploading every picture it takes and every sound it records (and there are applications, like Black Lives Matter protest recording and similar journalism where you'd want it to.)<br/>Is there enough horsepower in the device you carry to actually do the voice transcription and imaging recognition, or does it upload them to a server in the cloud to do the hard work, like Siri and Android apparently do?  If it gets to a server, the server can save anything it wants, but even if it's doing voice transcription on the phone, it could be uploading that very efficiently.<br/><br/>The big differences between this and Google Glass are that it's less visible to the people you might be observing (but a cellphone in your shirt pocket or on a jogging armband can do that too) and that the information it provides to the user is audio rather than visual (much cheaper to do, not always as useful.)  Basically, it doesn't look like _bragging_, and Glass did.",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>@ Lena Lingard,<br/><br/>You are correct, of course; but you're also laugh-out-loud funny in your spelling of the first word of your final line. It's even funnier to think of the copy editors cringing when they see that word! (I'm not talking about NYT copy editors; they apparently don't see the blog or the Comments. I'm talking about the copy editors who are part of the fun in the Comments section.)<br/><br/>As long as we're on the topic of pronouns and apostrophes, a story:<br/><br/>People at Sony Pictures Entertainment (a big movie studio) use email to communicate with people inside and outside SPE. Sometimes, the email accounts are \"hacked\" and the emails are released to the public.<br/><br/>This is a crime and should not be countenanced.<br/><br/>Anyway, some time back, a NYT Op-Ed columnist was preparing a thorough piece about gender discrimination in \"Hollywood\". She had an email exchange with the then-head of SPE, whose husband used to be a NYT reporter; both husband and wife are friends with the columnist. (For details, see the Public Editor's Journal entry for Dec. 12, 2014.)<br/><br/>In concluding their exchange, the head of the movie studio emailed the columnist, \"I HOPE YOUR HAPPY!!!\" along with affectionate personal remarks. The columnist wrote back, repeating the affectionate personal remarks, but writing, \"I hope you're happy\".<br/><br/>That exchange illustrates that NYT writers not only know how to spell contractions, but also that they resist using all caps when they write emails about gender discrimination.",
