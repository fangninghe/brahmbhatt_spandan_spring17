Overeating (too many calories) makes a person fat, because excess (unburned) calories are stored as fat in the human body. <br/><br/>Dietary fats have 50% more calories per gram than either carbs or sugars, so overeating fats will put a person over their calorie needs faster than overeating carbs or sugars.

When inspected more closely his resume for President is awfully thin, his message is limited and a bit shrill, the practicality of the message more than a little bit questionable. A longer campaign might well have exposed these weaknesses. If he had started earlier as suggested he might well have run out of gas before reaching the critical stages of the primary season.",

Consider these pitchers: Warren Spahn: from 1947 through 1963, there was only one year in which he did not pitch more than 250 innings; he only pitched 245.2 that year. In 1963, he was 42, and went only 23\u20137. He had 13 20  game seasons during that period, and pitched more than 300 innings twice. Early Wynn pitched more than 250 for eight consecutive years, 1951-59 (ages 31-39), winning 20 or more five of those years. Whitey Ford first pitched more than 250 in 1961, when he was 32. He also did it the next two seasons, winning 25, 17, and 24 during those years. Sandy Koufax, meanwhile, also pitched more than 250 in '61, when he was 25. He pitched more than 300 in 1965 and 66, winning 26 and 27 games in those years. There are more of course. (And, from the same era, consider the extraordinary relief careers of Hoyt Wilhelm and Roy Face.)Those were golden years for baseball and baseball fans. I'm not sure what Casey Stengel would have thought of pitch counts, but I think the answer is \u2013 \u2013 not much. As an aging Baby Boomer, I have spent entirely too much time wondering aloud why the pitchers of my youth were able to do what no pitcher would be asked to consider today.",

				"commentBody": "One way baseball could become relevant is to take on, as in head on, diving for the headlines, the racism in the team identities. The rules changes for faster play, various rulings, etc. could come but with Cuba joining the game in a multi-cultural and diverse world we are now fully global. The Cleveland team has a trademark cancellation lawsuit already filed against it although headlines have been few and far between. There is an ask for $9Billion in damages. But will the white, male billionaire team owners and their corporate sponsors see the opportunity here? Or will they throw their lawyers at the situation rather than look to the legacies they are leaving their grandchildren?<br/>The Native American identities are outdated and just plain wrong. To lead with America's game on a very current issue, to make a real and positive change by example, to take it back into the schools with the racist team identities in their mascots and names--the opportunity for moral leadrership and even team profits when the name changes are done with some planning and care(and male egos of the team owners sidelined), perhaps the game could regain some of its lost vigor and support. As the \"white people's game\"--look at the stands, not the players, and also the owners--the game will wither on the vine. As it should. Make it relevant. fully legitimate and inspiring again and a whole new fan base arises. ",

He had also gotten the civil rights act passed, and while most of us loved it, Johnson said on signing it that he had just lost the south to the GOP.  Nixon didn't really believe in very much other than himself, and he claimed to have a secret plan to end the war.  He also had his southern strategy.  In 1968, there were riots in Chicago, McCarthy ran for president (Eugene, not Joseph), and the second Kennedy brother was shot.  Martin Luther King turned against the war (if he had ever been for it), and then he too was killed.  I think after awhile people just wanted things to be normal, and Nixon pretended to do that.  In 1972 we had McGovern, who I supported, and Nixon.  Don't forget Wallace.  Nixon again got away with seeming to be moderate.<br/>We have had many progressive candidates over the years, and why none of them has succeeded I can't say.  The Republicans have been the Republicans for a very long time and I won't go into how they came to be this way.  I think the failure of progressivism lies more in the Democratic Party.  As I have said before I am just waiting to see which candidate the Democrats nominate, and I will support them.  Then it will be up to the voters.  Democracy means letting the people have what they want, and hard!",

It's critical the Democratic Party retain the White House and take back the House and Senate if any of our economic, infrastructure and climate problems are going to be seriously addressed in the NEXT five years (as they've been ignored for the last seven by Congress.)<br/><br/>But the Sanders/Clinton contest is doing a lot of damage to party unity, particularly by the quality of media coverage it's being given. For example - it's interesting a caucus \"win\" and a primary \"win\" are treated as identical in this piece. In the former, a few thousand votes - at most - are cast; in the latter, hundreds of thousands of votes are cast. Hillary has won nearly every primary state (which is why she leads by nearly 3 million votes cast).<br/><br/>Bernie's \"wins\" are almost all lower-voting caucus states. That's been his strategy, regardless of how Tad Devine or anyone else on the campaign is recasting \"regret\" now. And if Nevada is any indication, he has a lot of former Rand/Ron Paul supporters in his campaign now. The attacks are more personal; truth-stretching has crossed the line into misrepresentation (\"Misinformation works\" - Rand Paul), and the evasions - particularly his puzzling refusal to release his tax returns - are tarnishing Bernie's persona of \"trustworthiness\" while his caucus wins impart seeming \"momentum.\"<br/><br/>I'm disappointed his \"revolution\" is seemingly dependent on the most common tricks in the Republican playbook.",
