And we got a financial meltdown, an unneeded war, eight years of doing nothing about global warming, and the destabilization of the Middle East, trading al Qaeda for ISIS.  <br/><br/>A country paralyzed for a few months would have been preferable.  And who knows, the Supreme Court might have decided to do the logical thing and decide that since the Florida result depended on which methods were chosen to count and validate the ballots, the US result was in reality nonexistent and unavailable using accepted methodology.  In that case the logical thing would be to give the presidency to whoever received the most popular votes, since the Electoral College made sense only under conditions that no longer obtained.",

				"commentBody": "Mr. Bruni, no one could have tried harder than President Obama to build a bridge between the two sides of the aisle.  Have you forgotten he wanted to include three Republicans in his Cabinet in the true spirit of bipartisanship when he was elected in 2008?  Gregg backed out when it became obvious he would become a pariah in his own Party.  The bridge President Obama tried time and time again to build between himself and the Republicans, was the bridge to nowhere.<br/>Like others commenting here, I doubt if Clinton is elected, (and I hope she is) that the Republicans will welcome her with open arms, no matter how relieved they are that the clear and present danger of a President Trump is averted.  I suspect we will be subjected to more of the same of Republican obstructionism unless and until we get more moderate Republicans in Congress.  I also suspect that a Supreme Court nomination by Clinton would  go nowhere, as well.  Some Republicans are supporting Trump in the hopes he will be elected, and they can swing the Court to the right<br/>I only hope that Clinton will be elected, and that at least the status quo can be maintained.  I am afraid that is the best that can be hoped for given the current temperament of the Republicans in Congress, unless Clinton is elected by a landslide and has large coattails, and we get a Democratically controlled Congress. If that were to happen, then maybe just maybe the Republicans would become more open to overtures of bipartisanship by Clinton.",

They have been prompted, at various stages of Trump's campaign, to assault peaceful protestors at rallies, to be ready for violence against delegates if the convention did not go Trump's way, to shoot Hillary Clinton for treason, and to anticipate, months ahead, that the election may be rigged against him. And this is against a steady backdrop of calls to be heavily armed, to fear Muslims, immigrants and refugees, to distrust the media as \"biased\" and \"disgusting,\" to suspect that the Attorney General is in cahoots with the Clintons, and a drumbeat that President Obama was an illegitimate two-term leader.<br/>The paranoia and delusions of persecution Trump promotes will be with us long after this election.",

				"commentBody": "Ms. Dowd, you really don't do humor well.<br/><br/>This other-side-of the-shower-curtain glimpse at Norman Bates (sorry, I meant Donald Trump) isn't remotely humorous. Do you think the word \"predecessor\", for example, is in his vocabulary? Like \"inordinately\" was in Marian Crane's, this before she decided she needed to get cleaned up? <br/><br/>\"The poorly educated angry white people still flocked to my rallies and I knew they would carry me through.\" This is the place, Ms. Dowd, where, if you took a look at the famous 3:13 video of outtakes from his rallies, that the disconnection from reality between candidate and chorus begins and is the real news story of this election: it's utter insanity.<br/><br/>Trump's candidacy was built on the backs of hatred. Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, the latter's on steroids, anticipated Trump. What is it about a certain demographic of the electorate that considers America to be their own, to the exclusion of all others, whether native-born or hard-earned, like the Khan parents? Anger is madness, Ms. Dowd, and it's not funny.<br/><br/>You have Mr. Trump being disabused from his reveries as two orderlies frog-march him into the day-room to watch the 45th president being sworn in. And it isn't him. <br/><br/>This column reminds me of Simon Oakland's great summary in Psycho of what turned young Bates into the monster he became: \"He wanted to be his mother.\" Trump may not have any strong Oedipal urges but those he's displayed to us are more than enough. <br/><br/>He's dangerous, Ms. Dowd.",

It may also be that he is crazy like a fox and trying to shake up the American system in the same or similar manner in which the American system was created.  America was birthed out of an incendiary Revolution.  Mr. Trump is reigniting a bonfire that was left to die out over the last past and passed 50 years.<br/><br/>In the process he may be helping to take down Clinton, Inc. by causing Mrs. Clinton to accumulate a massive campaign and expense debt AND causing her to expend political capital.  In the process, it may be that Mr. Trump hopes that she will also expend her energy and ability to govern effectively.<br/><br/>Mr. Trump may be playing a big political game; it may be that he really does not want to be President.  But he is going to make Hillary pay for her selfish ambition in wanting to be president.  Mr. Trump is keeping it close, causing Hillary to expend resources of all kinds.  Mr. Trump may not win the war or land the knock-out punch in the end, but he will take a lot out of Hillary and Clinton, Inc. along the way.  For those of us who do not want a powerful central government to begin with this may be the best way for the People to win the 2016 Election.               ",
