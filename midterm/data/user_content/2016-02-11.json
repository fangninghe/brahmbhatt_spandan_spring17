It may be true but i avoids trying to know the reasons for their votes.  I think the economic decline of not-wealthy America is a root cause for much of this voting pattern with Republicans and it must also affect black as well as white Democrats.  Economic decline provokes fear, hopelessness, and anger, which can be too easily turned to hatred and self-destruction.  (I'm not thinking of Hillary or Bernie.)  I haven't mentioned racism, but racism is another one of the evils that can be inflamed in a condition of economic decline.  (I'm sure I need not name names.)",

This election will be like no other in American history because there has NEVER been a serious, highly qualified FEMALE candidate for President of the United States.  At the same time most average Americans are outraged at the state of politics in America and the obstructionist, wealth building republican/libertarian/tea party - and some democrat and independent - operatives that have allowed the wealthiest to literally take over OUR governments at all levels.  We are angry that we didn't realize what was going on sooner and the sheer arrogance of the financial elite. We want revenge.  These things can and will work together when we elect Ms. Hillary Rodham Clinton as the next President of the United States because she is the MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE AND HAS THE MOST POLITICAL CAPITAL TO GET THINGS DONE and Senator Bernie Sanders is our STRONG Vice President.  Meantime, all \"black folk\", white folk, people of other colors, women, men, gay do NOT feel the same way.  It is going to be a VERY interesting year.",

The US needs to stop trying and control the world,\u00a0 we continue to arm these rebels to fight Assad and this contributed towards the creation of Isis. This is a good answer to why we are trying to overthrow the Syrian government. <br/><br/>The main US argument against Assad is that he is a dictator and has no regards for human rights. Well, so who will decide who has respect for human rights or who is a dictator?? Who has given the US or NATO the right to certify who is a nice guy or a bad guy?? Who gave the NATO the right to kill Gaddafi in Libya?? And after all this, the US media starts to make a world opinion that suits the US foreign policy. <br/><br/>The US is going after Assad because Assad is unwilling to toe the American line. If in reality the US was against dictators then before going for Assad, they would have gone for the Saudi Kings and the Generals of Pakistan, both of whom have terrible human rights record and are dictators in their own way. But, Obama will not do that, but he will still sell F16s and give money to the Pakistanis.",

But it seemed easy to predict that when this administration negotiated with Assad over the poison gas, rather than oust him, we would preserve him indefinitely. With Russia's help, it seems more and more true. And, it happened immediately after Putin visited with Obama in America. And sometimes, when we have enemies, like the Castros, they stay around forever.  And Russia, the country that keeps Assad in power, and took Crimea, seems successful in its goals, while we seem incapable of doing anything without making matters worse (like in Libya), though we boast the most powerful military in the world. Russia is also the country we are now trusting to keep Iran honest, which makes no sense. We have never looked so weak and foolish in the last century. I know the readers of the Times are often Obama supporters and many think him a great president. I don't know how. Saving Sanders and Kerry, I don't know who would be worse. And, no, I am not a conservative. But, when people ask how Donald Trump can be successful, this is one of the answers. They don't feel their country is great anymore and he is promising it will be.

From a purely humanitarian point of view it seems that this war has reached a point where a victory by either side is the best for the population at large, because at least there will be the absence of war and destruction. Hardly anyone in the opposition represents am 'democratic' alternative as we understand it. To wit, the US hardly found anybody to support. The most capable opposition happens to be made up of Islamist factions. Hardly better than Assad and possibly worse. Witness Syria before the war and life under ISIS. So yes, Putin has turned the tables, but if one is capable of seeing situations not purely through a 'us against them (the Russians)' perspective, this might be the best solution for the civilian population as well as form the US. The last thing this country needs is yet another war in the Middle East with endless costs in blood and treasure and nothing to show for. As an aside, ISIS surely is more dangerous to its neighbors than to the US, so they should take the lead. We have been arming the Saudis, Egyptians and Iraqis to the teeth, so they for once should fight instead always asking the US to bleed on their behalf. It is time that we start limiting our wars to when out core interests are at stake, not engage in wars, just because they are there or because the Russians are in it.",

				"commentBody": "Well, pretty soon Iran is going to get billions of $$$ released by the USA.  Further, its oil wells will be completely modernized by Western expertise thus allowing it to bring in even more billions per year in oil dollars.<br/>A huge portion of that massive sum will be spent on weapons...all kinds of deadly stuff including nerve gas and other forbidden means of mass killing.<br/>ISIS will absolutely spread throughout the Middle East, flow into Egypt, Libya, and Africa.  The Euro Zone is completely asea when it comes to even making cursory back ground checks on millions of migrants flooding into those countries.  You can bet your last dime there are hundreds if not thousands of extreme Islamic radicals flowing in from all over their borders.<br/>I conclude the USA and other freedom loving nations are facing one of the most insidious threats to our existence in our history.  King Obama and his complete lack of foresight and any semblance of foreign policy has played right into the hands of Putin and the Islamic leaders of Iran.<br/>If we do not begin to use our full military might to purge this threat our nation and its people will suffer.",

Otherwise they should keep their whining to themselves. As for the Turks, this mess is on their doorstep and they have the most powerful army in the immediate region. But they direct their ire at the Kurds who are one of the few groups in the area actually fighting Daesh. Certainly the Turks aren't. And none of the major Sunni Arab nations have stepped up to the battle in Syria beyond a few airstrikes; this while Iran commits far more effort to their Shiite allies in Iraq and Syria.<br/><br/>It's worth repeating for the umpteenth time: This is not our fight. We are not at risk here. We did not start this mess (well, if you ignore the rise of Daesh from the ruins of the aftermath of the US 2003 invasion of Iraq). We can and should support those in the region who are affected but they have to step up and do the heavy lifting.  We should not do it for them.",

It's fair to hate Assad for his brutality, but his replacement by IS will have consequences that are infinitely worse.<br/><br/> Our policy in Syria has been an abject failure.   It failed because it was conflicted by Saudi interests in supporting the Sunni insurgents (mostly terrorists).   There is no one for the United States to back.  The Arab Spring has given way inevitably to The Great Wahhabi Terror.  We knew that dictators were the least bad alternative, but somehow we (Hilary Clinton and Barack Obama) ignored this dark truth.  (Papa Bush didn't topple Saddam in 1992 because he knew this.)  Whenever we unseated a secular dictator - Saddam Hussein, Mummar Qaddafi, Hosni Mubarak  - bloody chaos followed.<br/><br/>Leaving cruel Assad in power will save Kurds, Christians and other religious minorities from genocide at the hands of IS.  Assad winning will also weaken and may even destroy IS.  Let the Russians save their long-time ally.  We cannot afford the blood and treasure trying to build a nation where none can exist.  ",

Once again an American administration imagined that it could meddle in the affairs of a sovereign state in pursuit of regime change on the transparently cynical pretext of \"defending human right\" and the principle of self-determination! What has resulted is a conflagration that imperils the entire region and sets back Washington's own interests there, which many in the foreign policy making and defense establishments do not seem to recognize.<br/>There is a sense in which the tarnishing of America's prestige throughout the world serves it right for this bungled policy. The unnecessary horror and terrible human cost of Syria's internationally-driven civil war was largely avoidable, and the right actions by Washington in 2011 could have significantly ameliorated the conflict, rather than exacerbate the war, as its misguided actions did.",

Russia cannot be an empire without Ukraine, so they have moved to Syria for total control.  Unfortunately, Russia, and Syria, have no money.  Syria is not an oil exporter, and Russia has a mercantile economy doomed to failure.  They have one Soviet era aircraft carrier that travels with a tug boat because it breaks down.  Even their weapons systems are not that good.  What they are doing is repeating a mistake they made in Afghanistan.  As far as the flood of refugees, many Americans look at them as cowards waiting for someone else to fight their war.  Russia is not above starving people.  A reference to the Holodomor that Stalin inflicted on Ukraine.  When the Russians get hungry enough, and they are almost there, they will replace their government.  Until then, why should the U.S. care?  We have plenty of oil.  We don't need the Mid East at all.  Have a great day!",

And now these same powers are up in arms because their chosen side in this regime change operation is not winning, because the Russians are involving themselves in Syria? Why is it more legitimate for the foreign backers of he anti-Assad factions to involve themselves in Syria than it is the Russians? <br/><br/>I am no admirer of the Assad regime, though hard line Salafi groups like An-Nusra, Jaysh al-Islam, not to mention the IS, are in my view even more unsavory. At least, in contrast to the Salafi groups, the Syrian Ba'ath Party, founded incidentally by a Syrian Christian, Michel Aflaq, from which the Assad regime sprang, provided space for Syrian religious minorities such as Christians and Alawites.  That is not to say that the Assad regime was any paragon of religious or political toleration.  But it seems to me the current alternative is even worse.  <br/><br/>So again, the question, why is Russian intervention in Syria any more reprehensible than that of the Americans, Saudis, Turks, Qataris, etc?  Seems to me like a question of what's good for the goose is good for the gander.  But then I forgot, the solution to it all is to keep pouring gasoline on the fire and to fight to the last Syrian.
