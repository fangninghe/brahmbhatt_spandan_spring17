				"commentBody": "Very nice final wrap for Louis Bayard.  The real drinking game is how many times does a character in the Crawley family say:  let's go through or let's go up.  As Jay65 (do not understand how my moniker got changed by NYTimes), I was happy to be right in predicting one central fact and one that is merely a wisp of a hint:  Bertie came back; Tom and Miss Evans will get together very soon.  I learned that a Marquis outranks an Earl, or does one.  What precisely did Mary inherit from Matthew:  not the title of course, not Downton itself in 1925, so, merely his personalty, securities etc?   Patricia Hodge not only played the adulterous wife in Betrayal, but also the smart female barrister partner in Rumpole of the Bailey, no?  I watched the fund-raiser afterward:  character most missed from the Memorial segment (cannot believe they had Vera Bates in there):  Sybil of course.  Goodbye to All That.",

Assuming Lord Robert survives, does anyone know what would happen, upon Robert's eventual death, to the estate following the reform of British property law a few years later?  Mary's son with Matthew would become an Earl, but would she get the house and land?  Unfortunately young Master George is the right age to be a junior officer in WWII or an RAF pilot.  Hope poor old Barrow doesn't wind up with a chart of his young charges who don't survive (as in another English show:  To Serve Them etc).",

				"commentBody": "In the last few years, the NCAA has been disproportunately penal in acadenic misconduct cases, no matter if isolated, as the Fraiser matter, a single incident involving just one player.  In Brown's case, the NCAA neither found Brown complicite in the act itself, nor for failing to report the incident ito the proper authorities, which he did.  They punished him with a 9 game penalty for reporting the incident belatedly, and for lying during an NCAA interrogation , and then correcting his answer after consulting his arrorney .<br/><br/>Brown is not the only Big Time coach to get slammed for academic fraud violations recently.  I don't mean to imply Brown was unfairly singled out (although I'd like to know who dropped the dime, and whether the dime included allegations of widespread violations for which there was no proof)<br/><br/>Either way, it seems undeniable that the NCAA has been quite vigilant and punative in recent times with respect to academic fraud, except if it's epidenic and the violator UNC ( wink).<br/><br/>My question is this.  Is this vigilance essential to the NCAA's insistence that players who are obliged to work year-round are not emplouees, because they are STUDENT athletes, whatever that means, a claim that there seems to be consensus here is pure myth.  <br/><br/>Without that vigilance, the NCAA's postion becomes a one-footed stool, right.  So, is this more proof that the NCAA needs to go?  \"Not a soup question, now is it.\"",

Bindings have gotten better recently (last 5 years you're set).  Sure if you're boarding 100 days/year your replacement rate will be somewhat quicker. But most people are boarding less than 10 days/year and only need new equipment every 5-10 years (with lots of ebay used equipment available too).<br/><br/>I feel bad for the pros left out in the cold, but right now pro snowboarding (2-3 runs/day) has little relevance to the boards, boots, and bindings recreational boarders use for a 6 hour snow day.

				"commentBody": "Skiing and snowboarding didn't used to be luxury sports. In the 70's we used to stay in a ski club bunkhouse in Vermont for $2 per night. Real estate development made a few people wealthy but ruined the sport for all but the very rich by jacking up the costs beyond reach for most people. Lift tickets are over $100/ day. Lodging is higher than that. The equipment is way overpriced. <br/><br/>Forget it. It's just not that much fun to drive that far and spend that much for a few runs under what are often poor weather and snow conditions. It's too bad because it was fun when it didn't cost a fortune. The whole industry jumped the shark.",
