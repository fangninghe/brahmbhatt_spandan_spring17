I pumped breast milk at work, I carried my baby in carrier close to my chest everywhere I go, I also worked in a place where I'm the only woman at work. <br/><br/>One would think it might pose problems, but everything - and I truly mean everything - worked out. My boss and colleagues and I go about our work without any interruptions. (I should say too that I'm blessed with a baby that doesn't fuss or cry much, he's a happy baby.) I might also be blessed for the fact that I could almost always have the ladies bathroom all by myself for pumping breast milk or changing diapers. More importantly, I don't need \"accommodation\" from others because of the baby. We all have work to do, and I don't need anyone to do anything differently just because of I have a baby, as that would not be fair to them. <br/><br/>Still, I'm thankful for how open-minded and understanding my colleagues and boss were, and now, all these men can see for themselves a different world in which women with children can do the work just as well, and more. That first year allows me time to look for other options of childcare (which we eventually opted for group daycare), the time to bond with my baby, all without sacrificing my career.<br/><br/>It takes open-mindedness, and it might not be for everyone's situation (including job type, baby health and temperament). I am thus doubtful if this can be codified into policy.",

However I agree with him that the drastic 70% fall in oil price precipitates some deleveraging.  Anything like that will cause a major restructuring of an industry and any restructuring will be a drag on any economy as it is an adjustment of a nation's resource from one sector to another.<br/><br/>I also suspect that the Confidence Fairy plays a role.  The 70% drop in oil price is also a signal to investors that demand for oil is low which means consumption is low and this could lead to recession.",

I checked the assertion that a Harvard study CONFIRMED that 40% of firearms are acquired without background checks.<br/> The article cited is only a report on the study, which, as I read the article, has not been completed. The article makes it clear that the \"study\" was a survey (always suspect for accuracy) of just over 2000 firearms owners. That is a small number in relation to the number of firearms in the US. I am not even sure that this small sample group would rise to any meaningful statistical significance. Even given that the survey only found that  the LAST firearm acquired by each of the 2072 who answered the survey no background check was performed. SO if each owner had 2 firearms (probably a low number) the percentage of all firearms owned by this population could be as low as 20% acquired without background checks or as high as 70%. The result is meaningless. Not a very specific study, especially from Harvard. And there is no indication to how many, iWhere any of the 800 firearms acquired used for any criminal activity. Without such correlation the result is again essentially meaningless. There is no indication how the population was chosen leaving questions as to statistical bias. Each state has different requirements for back ground checks so unless the survey population was carefully chosen the study could be seriously flawed.<br/>  This makes everything in the article suspect for accuracy.",
