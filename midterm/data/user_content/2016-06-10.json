Won't work for Harvard, but for State-Colleges &amp; Communities, ABSOLUTELY.

You can find many more examples of how written communication has changed due to text messaging. Part of this is probably due to a desire to conserve energy. The character limits imposed by Twitter also contributes a bit. Words are regularly shortened, truncated and abbreviated. And, IMO, the younger you are, the more shortcuts you know and use regularly.",

				"commentBody": "I've read the PDF on the decision regarding Maria's case. I think the decision was fair. Lenient even. She withheld that she was taking this drug from her team, her coach, her physic, her trainer, her nutritionist, pretty much everyone. She never declared it on any forms as something she was taking prior to drug tests. She was hiding this. Maria is often known for her mental toughness. Did she have this strength because of discipline or because she knew she could outlast anyone because of the drug? It brings into question her big wins and the major titles she has won.<br/><br/>At this point. Maria is doing damage control. She's not going to win this fight. She is suspended, but what she is trying to do is keep her fans. Her post on Facebook only tells a small part of the whole story. The hardcore Maria fans will read her post and believe anything she says and disregard anything else.",

Yes, today, Chelsea Manning is automatically referred to as \u2018her\u2019 or \u2018she\u2019. But Chelsea Manning, for an act of conscience not so different from Ali\u2019s, is still in jail.
