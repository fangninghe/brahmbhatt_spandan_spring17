				"commentBody": "To my fellow Bernie supporters,<br/><br/>Regardless of what you do, this election is going to come down to between the poster child of a corrupt political establishment and a proto-fascist ham. The former has decades of experience to gently guide this country down its slow decline, while the latter has the know-how and judgment to drive us straight off the cliff. Some might see the second option as an opportunity to shake things up, that America will rise from its smoldering wreckage anew. But to most of us, Gotham isn't beyond saving, for we still believe in the possibility of reform, not revolution. So even as we rage against a rigged primary that never gave our candidate a fair chance, and despair at the prospect of more conflicts abroad and less stewardship at home, we can't escape the reality that Hillary Clinton is the only survivable outcome of this election. That is why I urge you to swallow your pride and indignation and vote for her on 11/8, so that we can live to continue the fight the very next day.",

The misogyny is astounding, but she's the first, like President Obama was the first and as such, has faces horrific racism and death threats for 8 years.
