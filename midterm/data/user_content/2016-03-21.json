If he felt that condition was unfairly revoked, he has every right as well to retire (or sue, which he decided not to do).<br/><br/>How many here ignore the ham-fisted way Williams handled this situation, and readily pass judgment on LaRoche's parenting skills, is beyond my keen.",

Chel$ki had dominant youth teams that Mourinho promised to use, but somehow never did. Van Gaal set in motion the young core of Bayern that is playing for Guardiola. The question is, does DeGea head for Madrid for real this time. If Mourinho is coming in, it will be the first time since Porto that he didn't inherit a team ready to win immediately. Can he build a team from scratch? He hasn't in over a decade.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Guardiola, like Van Gaal, values youth, and is about to take over the oldest team in the Premier League. It would be hilarious if both Manchester teams welcomed the biggest name managers with Europa League Thursday Nights. At least Guardiola will be spared the indignity of following a second lame duck manager to win a treble before he takes over.",

All I know is is that, without Diaw,had no chance.  The defense was superb, but it was the Spurs ability to get what they wanted on offense, to create easy chances in the half court off multiple passes, unscripted riffs off a schematic, impossible to game for, that beat Golden State at its own game.  It just might be that what we we saw last night is what Pop has decided to go with.<br/><br/>If so, it will be a work in progress, and all the taking thus far becomes irrelevant.  Next play.",

The Spurs have realized that they only way to beat Golden State is to force them to play slow, grind-it-out and pound-it-inside basketball, combined with stifling anti-Curry perimeter defense. They will never blow out the Warriors that way, but they will make every game close. Aldridge is just too big for small-ball. If these two teams meet in the playoffs it will be a series for the ages.

				"commentBody": "Regular season wins in the NBA are often tainted.  Playing a team in the second game of a back to back, when they're in the middle of a long road trip, or when their stars are sitting for minor injuries gives you an advantage.  This cuts both ways, off course.  But setting the record for regular season wins is not nearly as meaningful nor as important as winning in the playoffs.  Playoff basketball is a lot more intense than regular season games. Winning in the regular season is a sign that you excel when everybody is going 75%.  The Warriors are surely much more intent on winning the championship than beating the 1995-96 Bulls.",

I went to excellent public schools with lots of other middle income - not rich - kids. I had student loans in college, but the federal government paid for much of my graduate education in political science and Asian Studies. The economy and the plentitude of decent jobs made it possible to choose rather than just settle for things in our lives, and the intellectual and cultural atmosphere was serious, not trivial, due to the debate over the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement - not to mention the earliest stages of feminism. <br/><br/>All of these things I was very lucky to experience. But now we live in the age of economic insecurity, political theocracy, Trump and Cruz. Etc. Everything nowadays is either dangerous or trivial. But given the benefits of being an American in my youth, I feel I have some obligation to stick it out in the States while we all go to hell in a hand basket. <br/><br/>Then again, if Ted \"Torquemada\" Cruz becomes President . . . well, that will be a real test!",

I am surprised pundits, on any side, has picked up on The Donald's promise to install Carl Icahn as his trade negotiator. Whose interests would he serve? We should be talking about who really took the loot and how trade agreements in recent decades have benefited a certain circle of robber barons.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Yep! That's what Bernie talks about! without talking about grab, grab, grab...
