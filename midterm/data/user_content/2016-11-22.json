Most of these patients have serious illness.  In the last seven years, I've practiced medicine from New York to Wyoming, from North Dakota to Virginia, <br/><br/>In every locality paints all have the same complaints about healthcare.  Premiums are too expensive and deductibles are too high.  <br/><br/>Lowering the cost of premiums and lowering deductibles while  providing universal coverage and universal insurability to include even preexisting conditions is the mission.  This can be accomplished with political will, flexibility and work. ",

The insurance companies were given whatever increases they wanted this year, as they threatened to drop out all together.<br/>The system is a deeply flawed, but Democratic politicians were/are too partisan to recognize it. In 2014, they sleezily didn't announce premium increases until after the elections. This time 'round someone must have been asleep at the switch, and the increases came out before the big vote. Can't help but think it gave a yoouge boost to The Donald.<br/>Single payer healthcare insurance is not rocket science and is what we need (virtually ever other sophisticated economy has it), unless one is being bribed by the insurance lobby, which, sadly, is the only explanation for the system as we have it.

				"commentBody": "Richard, you misrepresent what Clinton actually said, and what I said.<br/>I didn't say money rules -- you did.  I said the opposite -- that our motives are complicated, we are filled with cognitive biases, and economics are often secondary to less rational social behaviors.<br/><br/>That's not evil; just human.  Since the beginning of recorded history, we know people have been prone to stupid, destructive behavior.  Any review of history will show you that self-government is an outlier, and that a collapse under Trump is more likely to be a catalyst for fascism than for social democracy.  <br/><br/>Our nation was designed on this sort of skepticism -- the fragmenting of power, the impossibility of big, rapid changes.  Sometimes progress requires movement sideways, rather than directly forward,  like a switchback trail up a steep cliff.<br/><br/>Sanders is a candidate, not a unique physical incarnation of social democracy or policy.  Clinton included his ideas in the Dem platform.  The tribalism of progressives deserting  in anger, abandoning the power of their unity with Democrats, and ceding the field to proto-fascist Republicans is an example of the  non-rational nature of political decisions.  Purist progressives chose to charge straight up a sheer cliff instead of taking the Clinton switchback, and now we lie broken at the bottom of the cliff.  <br/><br/>That is what I mean.  Love and admiration and hurt led you to abandon a productive route, and find disaster.  There's no phoenix here, just ashes.",

				"commentBody": "Indeed. Old Doc. My husband retired as a primary care doc a few years ago. He made less per year than our daughter who's a teacher! That's the lot of primary-care doctors. He was a board-certified family practitioner. Everyone assumers physicians are paid gobs and wads of money. He worked 80-90 hours per week. I often figured that if you divided out hours by the money he made, he'd probably make about what people who who manage retail stores do on an hourly basis. All that with 12 years of school, four years of college, four years of medical school, and three years of residency. He missed just about every event in our children's lives when they were growing up. I bet the CEOs of United Healthcare, Aetna, Humana, etc., and their multi-million-dollar annual salaries, whose policies dictate what physicians can and cannot prescribe and what they get reimbursed, don't have to worry about missing events and holidays. Or that the phone will ring in the middle of the night because a patient is seriously ill or threatening suicide.",
