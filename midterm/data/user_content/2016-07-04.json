				"commentBody": "Are all manufacturing jobs union? Many of the American workers who are so exercised about trade hurting their sectors are the same ones who oppose unions because \"right to work.\"<br/>Here's one approach: Workers insist on unions to keep their bosses from eating their lunch, and they also insist on tariffs and protectionism to keep foreign bosses from eating their bosses' lunch. Fine - their good jobs are protected. The rest of us pay higher prices for lower quality, but certain groups of workers stay prosperous in a dignified manner, because they don't perceive themselves as being charity cases (though they are). This keeps them from turning fascist. Good investment!<br/>Here's another approach: Workers insist on unions to keep their bosses from eating their lunch, but we have a globalized economy, so foreign companies might outcompete us, just as we might outcompete them. Unions keep us from undercutting foreign competitors, and we are forced out of certain industries. But instead of paying higher prices for goods, we pay higher taxes for social support (don't know how the numbers compare). Problem is those workers don't like social support, because it goes to everybody, including people of different colors and regions. They are resentful, because they feel very specially deserving, and want to feel worthier than others (maybe a color thing, maybe not?).<br/>You work it out. I can't.",

The problem, as others have pointed out, is not that we \"lost\" the trade war as between nations, but we lost control over the wealthiest individuals and multinational corporations that play shrll games with revenue to avoid taxes, leading to incredible concentrations of wealth away from the many and toward the few.

As a long time denizen of Silicon Valley (and IBM in New York and Boston before that) I can tell you that 'you aint seen nothing yet.'  The future of automation, artificial intelligence and networking with reduce employment to the vanishing point, except for the highly paid and crucial tech workers.<br/><br/>Think of self driving vehicles.  They are coming, they are safer, and they are cheaper.  But they will also displace millions of truck drivers, bus drivers and taxi drivers.<br/><br/>We need guaranteed jobs, guaranteed basic income, guaranteed medical care, and a thirty hour work week.  We need to stop giving all the profit to the one percent who do not deserve it, because of a historical division of labor between capital and labor which is now long gone.<br/><br/>To see what is needed go to YouTube and watch Comedy Party Platform (2 min 9 sec).

Mr. Krugman argument leaves out the difference between a good job (manufacturing Caterpillars) and a lousy one (Walmart sales associate).<br/>Because if would bring up what economists call distributive costs - if you are a Walmart employee you may be on food stamps<br/>2.  Distributive costs are a sensitive subject for Mr. Krugman, as he omitted them in his 1995 paper  that claimed that globalization had only a minimum impact on wages of those exposed to competition from low wage countries.   We know now that this was wrong.<br/>3. Mr. Krugman claimed  international trade was harmless to those exposed to it until 2008, when in a volte face he stated that the standard model \"might\" after all be correct.<br/>4. His 1995 paper had disastrous consequences for the American working class in good jobs (e.g. manufacturing) as it was seized upon by politicians of both parties to implement trade agreements.<br/>5. All throughout, Mr. Krugman exhibited contempt for those who lost their jobs, accusing them of \" moral outrage\" . When he got angry letters from the victims along the lines of, \"Well, if you lose your comfortable position as an American professor you can always find another job--as long as you are 12 years old and willing to work for 40 cents an hour.\" He responded with \"Such moral outrage is common among the opponents of globalization \"<br/>5. If Mr. Krugman disagrees with Mr. Autors second paper, he should submit a paper to a refereed journal - not misuse his blog for an attack.",

				"commentBody": "It seems to me that it all has to be looked t from a historical perspective. What happened when trade was restricted, when high tariffs were placed on goods from other countries?  Did local manufacturing increase, did wages increase?<br/><br/>Also look at what happened when certain companies decided to have their wares made in low cost countries. In the 1990s Walmart became the low cost leader and customers flocked to it to buy cheap shoddy made goods. Small town main streets like Twin Falls Idaho dried up. Other companies like Target did the same to compete, and instead of complaining about lost jobs, the politicians lauded them for making life cheaper. However, their customers were decently paid workers from places like the Rust Belt. Then they discovered those jobs were no longer available for their kids. <br/><br/>Those same people were buying Toyotas and Hondas because they made better cars than GM and Chrysler. Even Ford lost business except for its light trucks. Would higher tariffs kept the auto industry profitable considering the quality was not what the US buyers had come to expect?<br/><br/>Just look at the motor cycle industry. Suddenly you had bikes with starters, quiet, low vibration. fast, and reasonable prices. Harley actually benefited as more Americans rode bikes, and Harley became a boutique bike.<br/><br/>Trade is a two way street you can not defeat the law of supply and demand.",
