He's not in this for himself, as is apparent to all who know him--he's in it to preserve what's left of American democracy from the greed and megalomania of the oligarchy in BOTH Parties.<br/><br/>When he argues that he has a better chance of winning the general election than Hillary, he's stating a FACT--established by poll after poll after poll!<br/><br/>Democratic Party insiders are determined to force Hillary's nomination, nonetheless...counting on everyone else \"having no choice\" but to vote for one of the most widely disliked candidates since Nixon, rather than to see Trump become President. <br/><br/>It's a dangerous game, but they're willing to chance losing the Election with the candidate they own, rather than winning it with one they don't. If they blow this election with their intransigence, they may well set the Democratic Party back a generation. Remember the cautionary injunction, \"Pride goeth before the fall.\"",

All Drumpf has to say in a general is that he donated money to Thatcher's past campaigns and to her foundation and that he effectively owns her. And guess what? The Democratic Senatorial and House election committees have also accepted donations from Drumpf, as well. Imagine that.

				"commentBody": "That the Republican race for the nomination has ended before the Democratic race comes as a bit of a shock to those who not so long ago foresaw a possible multi-ballot affair in Cleveland. The outcome for each party may be clear but it is the Dems whose runner-up is proving more difficult to dispatch.  Clinton now must deal with a two-front campaign, while Trump can focus exclusively on her.<br/><br/>Allocating time and resources will present challenges for the Clinton campaign.  Every time she loses a state to Sanders by anything but a huge margin, her odds of winning the nomination actually increase but her general election prospects probably suffer.  Hopefully, by the time we get to Philadelphia, the Sanders supporters will have been encouraged by their leader to throw the full weight of their support behind Hillary Clinton.  And that had better happen in November because GOP turnout in the primaries has eclipsed Democratic turnout. <br/><br/>Whether or not Bernie Sanders is doing Hillary Clinton's campaign a favor or not remains to be seen.  Usually, a party comes together at their convention but.... Young people engaging in this process for the first time and feeling the Bern, are going to be an important voice come the summer and fall.",

				"commentBody": "Those Democrats and Cruz haters who are gleeful that Trump is now the presumptive nominee and allegedly easy pickings for Hillary in the general should take serious pause. Obama's  8 years of over reaching executive power, profligate spending, and apologizing for America at every turn has weakened us on the national stage and unleashed a new revolution amongst the angry, the unemployed, and the hopeless youth of our nation.  Hence, the birth of the likes of the populist Trump.<br/>    I find myself in the unfortunate position of having to hold my nose and vote for this reality show candidate not because I like or agree with his policies  but because he is a better choice than Mrs. Clinton who is on the verge of federal indictment and possible incarceration. It is a sad day in American politics.",

You can see it in Ted Cruz and in others besides good 'ol \"Pundit\" here. Donald Trump in his \"Lyin' Ted\" comment has somewhat isolated it as well. But rather than being about \"lying'\" the problem has much more to do with a sort of willful ignorance that has pervaded a certain segment of the electorate. <br/><br/>To isolate it you only have to ask yourself a series of questions based upon this comment:<br/><br/>What profligate spending?<br/>What apologizing for America?<br/>What overreaching use of executive power?<br/><br/>A certain segment of the American populace, BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT, has simply abandoned any pretense of seeing facts that are arrayed before them and instead view the world through assumptions that fit their worldview. It is frankly frightening.",

The guy is a self-righteous, sanctimonious creep - a cross-breed between Elmer Gantry, Joseph McCarthy and the Pillsbury Doughboy. The thunderous, apocalyptic, whiny overtones he uses are deliberate. He aspires not to be President, but Torquemada. He has damaged the full faith and credit of the U.S Government, cost taxpayers millions through his televised histrionic shutdowns of government, and is utterly despised within his own party.<br/><br/>He wants you to believe that up is down, down is up, white is black, black white, and yes, among other things, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton will not rest until 14-year-old boys finally get to shower with little girls in transgender bathrooms all over the land.<br/><br/>The man was a sickening toad, and ultimately, millions saw just that.
