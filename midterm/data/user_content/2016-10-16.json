				"commentBody": "Higher pays and bigger chances of advancedment could pay off when two conditions are met. <br/><br/>First,  a pay rise is meaninful in relative terms, not absolute terms as time progresses. <br/><br/>The morale for employess is boosted when they are paid higher at their jobs than other similar jobs. <br/><br/>If they could get an equivalent pay at another job,  they couldn't find any reason to work hard. That is, they could leave the job in favor of another one with a greater pay. <br/><br/>The implication is that job morale stimulating efficiency wage matters when it is bigger than on average and that, if average wage levels in an industry rise to a point of no significant differences, its impact could noticeably decline, with increased consumers prices levels. <br/><br/>Second, even if higer paid employees work hard, the resulting hike in sales and profit for employers is possible when the economy is high.  In a slow economy, higher pays would put more of a burden on employers as the aggregate demand is meager. <br/><br/>So employers are tempted to downsize and cut payroll even if such action could trigger a vicious cycle of recession. After all, businesses are just profit maximizers, not a coordinator of macroeconomic order. <br/><br/>Finally, if a business is on the export side, raising pays for workers will be less likely. In a globalized cutthroat competition, price is often a determinant of competitveness, thus higher labor costs leading to higher prices, lower sales. <br/><br/>In short, the issue is really tough.",

There's just too much there to overlook.  <br/><br/>It all boils down to power.  <br/><br/>If you get President Trump you will get the unsavory human being that has stepped on people for his entire career.  I don't have enough faith that checks an balances would curb Trump's inner Mussolini from stifling opposition.  He has a history of using lawsuits or the threat of them to intimidate business opponents.  It's no stretch to expect that his AG would be busy doing the same kind of thing. ",

Perhaps if you looked behind the mega-speeches Sanders put on in college towns, you might remember that people differ...not everyone votes the same. <br/><br/>It's almost as if you're desperately trying to find something to criticize Clinton for amidst the melt-down that is Trump, in order to meet some arbitrary 'fairness'. <br/><br/>Well don't.
