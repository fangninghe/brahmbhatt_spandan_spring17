The walkers only got Sam because he started whimpering and crying, and eventually got Jessie when she started screaming as he got eaten. Rick and the others were quiet, so they stayed safe, but even Carl started attracting walkers when he called for help to get free from Jessie's grip.",

				"commentBody": "Sigh. I heartily agree with everything the writer said. I think, in the end, Chris Carter et al simply tried to do way too much in a mere six episodes. Alas, rather than make a compelling case for further episodes, this season really does the exact opposite, causing many die hard fans of the show when it was great to go running back to those first seasons (maybe 1-6 or so). Except of course for the episode where Mulder and Scully meet the Were-Man. That episode proves that we need more, much more, Darin Morgan.",

				"commentBody": "I think it bears repeating - Friedman's analysis didn't predict something outrageous like a perpetual motion machine.  The basic idea behind his analysis seems to be that it is economically feasible to close the output gap that opened up after the financial crash, if a big enough stimulus is applied, which is what Sanders' program is.<br/><br/>Now, that may well be wrong; US output capacity may have suffered a permanent loss; maybe such a big stimulus is not even economically feasible;  maybe Friedman made an error in his analysis; maybe Friedman made an error in his assumptions.<br/><br/>What tells any objective observer that the criticism of Friedman is not in good faith is that Krugman went after it as though Friedman was violating the second law of thermodynamics.  This graph on the left is exactly that.  <br/><br/>Perhaps pundits and public commentators should retire, like the better sports people, when they are at the top of their game.",

Then dig holes and fill them back up.  The public sector could put people to work easily if not for a failure of imagination and the denigration of the collective good started by Reagan, egged on by his political descendants and the plutarchs, and allowed by the useless Democrats.

All of the major scientific funding agencies, major universities, etc. have placed huge amounts of information and interactive tools online, which is incredible for those of us who remember being limited to low-quality excerpts in a textbook and having questions which couldn't be answered unless you knew someone with access to a university library.<br/><br/>I think the right approach is to accelerate roughly what's happening: let teachers be sensitive to this issue and ensure that students have options but also as a country recognize the importance of making access to the defining technology of our century available to everyone.",
