There was a time when we were taught that idealism was a virtue, not a character flaw, as Hillary Clinton seems to be suggesting.   He Is giving us new hope that there is actually a way to end the immoral, business-as-usual politics rampant in Washington for such a long time.  If we can also give him a decent Congress, he will make it possible to achieve the goals he is proposing.  He has my vote, and I hope come November he will be elected.",

When my dad went to the state college it cost about $ 35 a semester (when college was subsidized by the state) and now it's about $20,000 a year. But my salary isn't exponentially higher than my dad's was. The cost of state universities is insane. And my taxes are still going toward funding Medicare and buckets of meds for very old people who enjoy a retirement I will never have. Yet I have to argue with my insurance company just to get them to pay up on an ER visit. I'm still paying for the aftermath of wars that Clinton voted for. She favors more war in Syria. Luckily she's been replaced by a Secretary of State who's accomplishing something that will lead to more stability.",

This happened when Obama was running for President too, but post Great Recession, the stakes feel higher. Bernie has tapped into the ethos of our time and it's something that HRC, even with all her years of experience just can't seem to grasp--and that makes all the difference. When I was hearing President Sanders talk about how FDR was his role model I believed him! Turns out the New Deal is not just something we read about in our high school history class, it's a movement that we have a possibility of helping usher today in 2016! Incredibly excited for the future. Let's not give into the fear and the mediocrity of pragmatism.

Like Churchill said in WWII, if Hitler invaded Hell I would make a favorable comment about the Devil in the House of Commons,  Bernie's running on small donations now, but when the general comes who will be tapped out first?

The constant finger wagging for attention, moving about, grimacing and insistence on getting in the last word, even about the bizzare issue of Kissinger and Cambodia (what?!), did not come across as presidential. It was more reminiscent of a performance by Jim Cramer of Mad Money. He has had a good week, but this was probably his worst debate performance, by a lot. In contrast, Hillary obviously set out to keep her cool much better than in their last meeting, and it worked. Extreme amounts of animated passion are wonderful for an activist, but the person who can keep it together and not be overly reactionary will accomplish much more. Obama has been an 8-year, real-time example of this.",
