Google and Apple might both be well known Silicon Valley companies in the phone business but they are radically different, especially in their approach to privacy. Google lives of your data. Apple lives of selling hardware. They have VERY different incentives with respect to your privacy.<br/><br/>I work on mobile security and it is a very big difference Apple and Android phones. As a software developer it can actually be quite frustrating to program iOS devices because so much common user data is completely inaccessible to a developer. E.g. there is no way for me as a software developer to create a program that reads of the email address a user has stored on his/her phone. Seems like a rather trivial bit of data right?

They can make good choices or they can make bad choices.  They can improve their lives or they can make it worst.  This is true no matter what social/economic level they are at.  Years ago the NYT had an article about an executive who had made over $300,000 a year and recently they had an article about a coal miner who had made $1500 a week (in a very poor section of America).  Both guys made bad choices with their money.  The executive was working as a clerk at the time of the article and the coal miner was on public assistance.  You may not control everything in your life, but you have more than people give you credit for. ",

Even third parties from outside the country, which is what happened back when export of encryption was much more heavily restricted as a \"munition\".  The other problem is that it will kill foreign sales for US hardware and software, and cause development of strong encryption in the US to lag behind the rest of the world, ultimately damaging US national security substantially more than the inability to get into the phone of a couple of dead workplace shooters.",

The American people do not get to elect a new C.E.O. of Apple, if they do not like its policies. There is no equivalent accountability for Apple, nor is there even the limited transparency the Freedom Of Information Act provides regarding the workings of government.<br/><br/>The Feds may collect info you rather they not have, but at least, unlike Apple and other corporations, they are not in the business of selling that information to others who may use it in seriously harmful ways. At any given time the Feds idea of national security may or may not align with your own, but at least American security is an essential part of their mandate.

In binary form it could only operate on the single phone at issue (because that's how the program would be written; see the judge's order), so even if the binary was \"leaked\" to the world it would have no practical use. Only Apple would be able to render the tool usable on any iPhone (unless code signing is cracked). <br/><br/>(I recognize that this puts incredible pressure on the company to keep its signing key safe, but that was true even before this episode.) <br/><br/>The \"weakness\" is actually the legal precedent that would be set were Apple to be compelled to cooperate.

As this case illustrates, government officials in the course of their of their duty to protect us, are also using this technology. Do you want terrorists to know where all of the police in a given city live? How about the whereabouts of the nuke plant staff? This isn't about protecting somebody's photos of their lunch or the government staying out of our flirtatious phone calls.  This is about preventing access to our real-time locations, plans, habits, routes, finances and conversations by the people would end up with it: terrorists, violent ex husbands, tyrannical leaders of countries who want to silence dissent or track American visitors, and on and on. We call them phones,  but they can be harnessed by people who mean us harm to track movements, record and transmit photos, videos, conversations, messages, without our knowlege or consent. Creating a key to millions of these devices for use by the \"good guys\" sounds great, but who will end up with it? How will they use it? It is kind of like the atom bomb. We have spent every minute since we invented it trying to keep everyone else from getting it.",
