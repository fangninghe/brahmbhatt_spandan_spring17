				"commentBody": "We just returned from a short trip 2,000 miles from our shores, the island of Curacao less than 40 miles from Venezuela. I was very much looking forward to getting out of here for a time to relieve the stress brought on by the fact that millions preferred a spectacularly unqualified man to someone who had studied, prepared and gathered experience to handle one of the most difficult jobs in the world, the presidency. Away, the brain refused to turn off.<br/><br/>I fear for the future of our nation and I will celebrate not one moment when many of the millions who voted for Trump see what a radical mistake they made. The consequences will be too dire for joyful noise.<br/><br/>About the only hope is the thought that Trumpism might lead to some sort of realignment and a coming to the senses whereby rancid, unending partisanship is pushed to the side. I have unbounded hope in the American public to find the right way, even if right now depression is the natural path.<br/><br/>America, by the way, is not in decay. The roads you wrote about, with  exceptions, are the envy of the world, well planned, built and maintained. America also remains the creative energy source of the world, energy built on the lack of a firm class structure and the ability of quick minds and flowing capital to rearrange the old and imagine the new. Relax.<br/><br/>We have deep problems and Trumpism threatens to make them much worse. Still, adversity is well known for the advantages it offers the alert and the eager, American qualities.",

One only has to try to drive out of Sydney along the only realistic route out of the city to the west - Parramatta Road - to see what lack of planning and lack of good engineering can result in.  The U.S. did a stellar job in infrastructure development but that was all decades ago.  Well-maintained??????  Who are you kidding?  Not for 35+ years! Most of the bridges on the Interstate system are more than 20 years' overdue for replacement.  While the basic engineering behind the U.S. highways system remains despite this lack of maintenance, the actual surface of our highways is appalling - riddled with potholes and uneven pavement that's more like that of the road surfaces in 3rd world countries than that of a major world power.<br/><br/>Australia's inter-city rail system is on a par with that in the U.S., perhaps providing a reason for that aspect of national infrastructure going unmentioned here - both lag 50 years behind the rail systems of Europe, China, and Japan.",

							"commentBody": "I wondered about the roads bit, myself. Are US roads worse than Australian roads? Remember we have a LOT more people -- 12 times as many - in roughly the same space (continental US is close to the size of Australia!) -- and in most of the US, we have a rough winter climate 7 months of the year. This is devastating to any roads and bridges.<br/><br/>Australia has a climate similar to that of Southern California -- mild all year, no winters. Is it really fair to compare road maintenance in such a gentle climate to (say) Milwaukee or Cleveland or Boston?<br/><br/>For what it is worth, in my Midwest area they are working on roads at least 9 months of the year. Our \"orange barrels\" are almost a joke. We just had all the major bridges downtown completely rebuilt from scratch at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. So I think this allegation is grossly unfair.",

Of course, they said this when they believed Hillary was going to win a landslide victory. After the election, they got curiously silent and when pressed....started angrily saying \"you can't make me leave my own nation!\" Huh. Hypocrites!<br/><br/>BTW: Neither Australia nor New Zealand nor Canada is \"welcoming\" to older retirees or immigrants over 45 (!!!) and they demand not just a job, college and desirable skills but money in the bank to prove you can afford to settle there. Canada has a \"points\" system so harsh, that most Americans would be rejected right off the bat.<br/><br/>Their STRICT immigration laws, strictly enforced, is why they are \"doing better\" than the US -- they don't have to support a huge underclass of poor, unskilled illegal aliens with anchor babies.
