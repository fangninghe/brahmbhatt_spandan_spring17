				"commentBody": "Isn't it obvious by now that our approach to managing the economy is primitive and ineffective?  We remain irrationally reticent about developing innovative means for organizing economic activity and so we remain subject to unpredictable fluctuations.  <br/><br/>We clearly need to develop a balance between free enterprise and rational economic management.  We still believe that management is necessarily stifling and oppressive.  The solution to this is plain.  If management of the economy is made entirely transparent and truly democratic then it will be responsive to the full range of considerations.  It will be the antithesis of stifling and oppressive.  It will in fact bring a substantial measure of economic justice to our system while at the same time ensuring economic activity that is both robust and rational.  <br/><br/>This approach can be termed Participatory Economic Management, parallel to Participatory Democracy (a a growing political innovation).  It's time to give serious thought to the design of such systems.  Technology will certainly play a key role, making it possible for large number of people to participate in the gathering and processing of economic and political data and in deliberation and decision making.  <br/><br/>Our current system, as contentious and stumbling as it is, has been remarkably effective in some ways.  The next system will inevitably be a dramatic improvement, just as capitalism and socialism were dramatic improvements in their times.  ",

				"commentBody": "This article overemphasizes cheap gasoline as the main economic benefit from low oil prices. We must keep in mind that oil is not only a source of energy, but is also the primary lubricant and a raw material for such industries as plastics, synthetic rubber tires, petrochemicals, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and many other industries. Consumers and corporations benefit from lower transportation costs (ships, airplanes, trucks, taxis), lower heating oil bills, and reduced cost pressures in industries using oil as a raw material. <br/><br/>Ever since the first oil shock in 1973, every recession has been preceded by a spike in oil prices prompting inflation and tight money -- none of which conditions exist today. Conversely, no recession has been preceded by record low oil prices, negligible inflation and near-zero interest rates. <br/><br/>Earth to chicken littles: the sky is not falling. ",

For awhile analysts were contributing this to China's economic slow down, however the Chinese economy is still growing at just under 7% , while the US economic growth is less than half of China. <br/><br/>So rather mentioning the weak US economic policies , which contributes to the confidence of consumer and businesses spending, blame China and falling oil prices as well.....",

Irony-of-ironies I now live in a time where this history is repeating itself. Why don't we spend? Are you kidding me! For 40 years the working people have had just everything taken away from them: secure jobs with benefits, affordable health care and education, and pensions to  name a few. Forty years of Ayn Rand loving neocon scams have emptied the coffers of federal, state, and county treasuries.  The 99% see what money remains fueling endless wars and of course continuing to stuff the overflowing pockets of the 1%. So, I suggest if you want to get economy rolling you go talk to those folks. Who knows maybe they can onshore a little of their I'll-gotten gains from their many offshore accounts to help the nation out. Yet, I highly doubt it, because they only take care of themselves.",

The availability of ride sharing services and the expense of buying a car is causing a paradigm shift in attitudes. for all except baby boomers and older Americans who have still have a mostly strong affinity to car ownership.

As oil is such a basic commodity of the world, low prices can mean low demand. Less ships shipping commodities, less trucks delivering imports and exports, less planes delivering people and goods. I don't think it's just about whether the family is going to visit grandma or not, or if they'll spend the savings on other things. I'd like to think that we're less reliant on oil as a basis of our economy, and the producers are opening the taps to try and ward off other options and stay relevant.",

Sure, there are other factors like a slowing Chimese economy, but on the whole these differences are about economics and the competing interests of consumers vs. producers, etc.",
