				"commentBody": "Some blame the Senate for going into recess without approving Zika funding. And while that's correct, the real issue is that Republicans have refused to allow a bill to come to a floor vote that hasn't come with ridiculous riders like defunding parts of Obamacare or Planned Parenthood (and with weird pork barrel spending related to the continuing operation of military bases in certain states). The blame clearly rests with them. If they were serious about preventing a serious disease from causing birth defects (and non-negligible health problems for people actually affected by the virus), they would present a clean bill for a vote, and it would pass.

				"commentBody": "@Roy Boswell - You're making a lot of inaccurate assumptions. There are good jobs to get, but many younger people today seem to want a particular job at a particular salary, and see no point to taking anything else. And just because you believe that previous generations \"always made a decent wage with benefits\" doesn't make it true.  Employer healthcare didn't exist in the private sector for decades, just the union jobs had that perk. Most companies didn't offer pensions to anyone except the higher ups, and only started offering health insurance to attract better employees. And 401ks, a very imperfect and potentially unreliable retirement savings plan, are relatively recent (and crashed in 2008 wiping out years of savings/gains).  So don't go spouting broad generalities that are mostly inaccurate.",

I am also disturbed that those in charge of our Olympic team would allow them to leave the village , without chaperones in the wee hours to go get drunk at a party . Lochte's propensity for this kind of behavior was already well - known . <br/><br/>These self -entitled young men were so stupid as to think that they could use the gas station's rest room as non-paying customers arriving in a cab ( this isn't the US , guys ) and then to top it off , break down the door and damage God knows what else there . And then to make up a story about being robbed in the host country by the police with a cocked gun placed to your forehead !<br/><br/>I say ban them from further Olympic competition . We all do stupid stuff when we are young , but this is beyond the pale and they were entrusted to represent our country in the most prestigious sporting event in the world . They do not deserve to compete in another Olympics .",

When stats come out about labor force participation? -- does not mean concern about, care for, energy put into or solutions or programs proposed.

It has been confirmed that the swimmers were confronted by men dressed as police i.e., security guards who pulled a gun.  It's not far fetched to believe that they indicated they would let the guys go for a little cash.  That's called robbery, even in Brazil.  Why so much self-hate America?",

Just watch the foolish statement issued by their spokesman endorsing the bad behavior of the 4 athletes. It also reveals how terribly inferior Brazilians in general feel towards the rest of the world (especially towards the US). Brazilians feel they were always encroached upon by the \u2018powerful\u2019. Brazilians are probably not alone, and I would dare say that some African-Americans watching this might well feel a similar outrage: four successful white american males getting away with petty crime. Yep, it just happened again.<br/><br/>In another article I recently read in NYT the reporter ended by saying the olympic party cost a lot to the struggling Brazilian economy (I agree), and that the best thing people could do would be to enjoy it (I agree even more). The four swimmers surely took this advice over the top. Lochte went out of his way to give that daydreaming interview to NBC, where he incredibly fantasized about the would-be robbery (he is a fabulous storyteller - he surely fooled me with that one).<br/><br/>Its ridiculous to say they should be stripped of their medals,. But it would be good for everyone, especially for young american kids inspired by the accomplishments of these 4+ swimmers, if they publicly admitted their mistakes. And please don\u2019t take too long, because I feel matters might get messier.",

They are not diplomats, they are not ambassadors, they are not surrogates for diplomats either - they are just regular tourists. What is really sad is that the Brazilian police, embarrassed by seeing a security guard point a gun and get money from tourists on a tape viewed globally, tried to pretend that the athletes told lies - wow, what hubris!  As for Rio and Brazil - we've seen enough to be wise now, and will not ever go there for any reason. As Yoda might say, backfired it did!",

				"commentBody": " What strikes me about this article is that while the world is watching the Olympics and looking at these world class athletes as heroes, it can easily be overlooked that not all of these athletes are world class people.  Ryan Lochte and his teammates made fools of themselves by falsely claiming they were robbed at gunpoint.  Multiple videos from their entire night were made available and it became clear that the accusations were a lie.  This is disappointing because as I routed for Team USA in the swimming events I felt like I was almost a teammate of theirs.  That's the beauty of the Olympics.  Anyone from any of the representing countries can tune in and feel like they are part of the action.  The Olympics bring out the patriots in us Americans.  To see the men I routed for in the swimming pool turn out to make such poor decisions is disappointing.  If these swimmers make the Olympics in 2020 it will be hard to route for them.  This goes to show, athletes should not be idolized for athletic accomplishments.",

You expect them to go to national TV to lie about a crime, during an event like the Olympics when all the eyes are turned to that country and not get any attention? The police at first were investigating the robbery they claimed they went through. Then got to the bottom of the story. And still investigating. Grown men vandalize a gas station and go cry to the world saying they were robbed and it's the Brazilians who are the foolish babies? I don't think so. ",
