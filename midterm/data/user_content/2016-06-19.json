				"commentBody": "I am amazed at how many people on the right still cling to the notion that one can get generous cash assistance, free public housing, food assistance and medical care with no effort and thereby match the living standards of middle class Americans. I find this resentment  voiced in sentiments on social media and in private discourse. People really believe that you can have a decent standard of life by what they perceive as cheating the system. Life is hard, hard, hard for those forced by whatever circumstance to subsist on public assistance. Those complaining about so-called welfare cheats really have no idea what life is like for those on public assistance.",

I got very sick and had to apply for benefits.<br/>I couldn't believe how difficult the paperwork was and how easy it is to lose a benefit. I'm reapplying for one now because I failed to send in some forms I never got. I'll be out a big chunk of my income (I'm at the national poverty level) until it's corrected.<br/>I also had to take on my health insurance carrier this year when they dropped two important meds. I felt like a general going into battle; I spent ten weeks exploring every venue. I did finally get the meds but by now I know what resources there are to help. <br/><br/> My Haitian home health aide, after listening to me on the phone nonstop,who is a citizen and has been in this country forty years said she wouldn't have the language skills.<br/><br/>I can't imagine someone with no resources or education  getting  benefits even if they are available. This is harder than the job I had teaching children with severe learning problems.",

The Republicans have certainly shown they are willing to ignore Constitutional duties, impede the ordinary functioning of government, and obstruct and ensnare any legislative process in the name of political expediency.

And I mean *progressive* senators - not the Republicans that the DNC have relabeled as Democrats, and who Obama supports in primaries against true economic progressives.<br/><br/>Fact is, Trump is more likely to actually *want* a robust economy, and is likely to be more effective at getting stimulus, with his willingness to go against the establishment, and Republican congressional leaders having little choice but to go along - or face defeat.<br/><br/>OTOH, If the ex bankers Hillary appoints to key positions say that too much stimulus is bad - do you really think Hillary will disbelieve them?  I am not calling her corrupt.  I think it is actually worse than that.  My assessment is that Hillary genuinely believes as Obama does - that these bankers have the best solutions for everyone, and that if we go against their wishes, it would be a huge mistake.  That actually portends worse, because the people she respects are ideologues.<br/><br/>Ideologues will double down on failed elite policies, even as these policies further destroy the world economy, and give us right wing extremists - eventually worse than Trump.<br/><br/>At least Trump is a pragmatist.

It would be a wonderful thing for all high school graduates, particularly those from affluent backgrounds who have a greater chance of being represented by the federal government that their parents love to demonize, to visit other countries and live among those that will never ever have the opportunities that affluent people have. It's easy to see extreme poverty from a distance and look away. My life has been changed forever by living from day to day constantly seeing people live in extreme poverty. That the United States has so many children living in extreme poverty speaks volumes about the character it's citizens.",

She has said she wants more in Syria for example, outright confrontation with Russia.<br/><br/>What she says on economics is what Republicans say. And trade agreements.<br/><br/>There is one voice of dissent, and it is the very uncertain trumpet of Trump.<br/><br/>Hillary is a serious problem, and Trump exists as a live option because of her as much as the clowns of the Republican Clown Bus.<br/><br/>Democrats could still say no. Even if they don't, it is important to speak up before she starts in opposition to the wars, the neocon adventures, and the neo-liberal Wall Street Washington Consensus economics.",
