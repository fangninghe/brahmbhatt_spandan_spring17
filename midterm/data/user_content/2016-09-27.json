It hurt Gore when he debated with Bush, and it's going to really hurt Clinton. In a college classroom, she's would have done well.

Recently, I have read the article \"Intellectuay, Yet Stupid\" by Nassim Taleb. It is a must read if one wants to understand why Trump's numbers will go up. Trump is a genius in persuasion. His statements are short and easy to remember. It is a completely open race. Time will tell.",

If you try to challenge him too much, he can be quite tricky in turning an argument against you even when he is lying. This debate was kind of like the Ali rope-a-dope. Could Clinton have been more subatantive? Yes,  but she needed to win and these debates are often less about the issues than who has command of the room and the tactics he or she uses to maintain that edge. Clinton let the blowhard huff and puff until he was gasping to make sense.",

He is an ignorant, uneducable, psychologically disturbed man. He thinks in tweets: he couldn't look at a map and tell anyone where Iran is, where is Iraq is, where Afghanistan is, where Syria is; or how is the Constitution amended, what is the role of the Majority Leader of the Senate--Trump can't answer any of these questions. Stamina? What does that mean? He demonstrated he has neither physical nor mental stamina. The last thirty to forty-five minutes the guy was reduced to an incomprehensible, ignorant man who could talk about nothing but himself. He had no self-control; he was clearly out of his league and had no clue what he was doing on stage. I could go on, but he is finished. He has no idea of what it means to be president. Donald, you are a loser, you have no sense of who you are : to leap from that vacuous position to the demands of the presidency is beyond your comprehension.",

				"commentBody": "It is an interesting issue.  Mrs Clinton needed to rise above the bar set for her and Mr Trump just needed to hit it.  In this instance I would say that she emerged the victor.  Arthur Brooks wrote a piece about Gore's infamous sighs and how Mrs Clintons performance was on par.  To that I would say that we were obviously  watching two different channels or , god forbid, he is holding Mrs Clinton to a different standard than other male candidates.  I was perfectly pleased that her face remained calm and passive.  There were points toward the end when Mr Trump was going on about birthism that she looked ready to pounce that I turned to my friends and said, \"that is the face that an anti Hillary person will love\" but she also reminded me of my own parents/grandparents in that calm collective expression that is letting you have your say before calmly explaining that there may be more to an issue than you are aware BUT it is still worth the time to let you have your say.  There is no \"sigh or checking your watch\" moment and if there was I would calmly and nicely say to Mr Brooks that he should have been paying as much attention to the disengaged, petulant, and bored face of Mr Trump instead of looking for what everyone was afraid would happen, the informed person condescending to the uniformed person in Mrs Clinton which did show up in Mr Trump.  To that point though, it may be to whom we believe will be the best president.",

How does one defend against accusations?  In many of these cases it is not innocent until proven guilty, it is guilty until you come up with a better answer.
