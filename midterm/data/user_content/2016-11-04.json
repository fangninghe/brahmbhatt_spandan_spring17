These threats are not acceptable and we must be prepared to storm Congress in droves to show our displeasure if the BIG democracy-destroying money masters' obstructionists pull something like this.  No civil war in America.  We'll just make sure the obstructionists suffer from personal class action civil suits, and Justice Department action against their treasonous behavior.  The majority of us do not agree with their tactics.",

We are regular shoppers of the Trader Joe's in the suburbs of Boston, where the mood is relaxed, service is with a smile, and shopping is easy. We tried to pick up a few things one afternoon in New York City on a weekend and to check out the Upper West side's store. The scene was like nothing we had experienced at any other TJs. So I think you're analysis is correct. And in terms of mood,despite the fact that there is a bank of check-out agents, the line to check out snaked around the store. Estimated check out wait time exceed 30 minutes. We got out as fast as we could. Happy that we weren't dependent on this particular branch. But I have to say there was nothing to smile about there. And that is a management problem.",

				"commentBody": "Trader Joes' workers and customers in California are constantly moving.  It is a place that is never at rest.  I respect all of the clerks.  I talk to them and give them sympathy.  I compliment their T-Shirts.  I am put off by Vogueing - the peculiar acting of grocery store clerks and their customers conduct while working with or buying groceries and waiting in line.  I do not like clerks who try to make me happy.  <br/><br/>In Campbell, a TJ clerk with a rough face was falsely accused by a nutty customer that he harassed her.  He has rough skin.  He was reprimanded and threatened with being fired, and it may have happened.  He was extremely upset and I informed him that he was a great clerk who I enjoyed seeing.  Though I enjoy seeing so many fresh faces at TJs, I prefer to see people earning a living wage.  <br/><br/>TJs does not hire its workers to work full time schedules, shakes up their schedules weekly, and prohibits petitioning at in the lawful apron area of the stores.  In other words, TJs attacks the constitutional and case law protected legal rights of political canvassers to collect signatures in public zones see Pruneyard case (where Campbell, Ca TJs operates).  TJs has competition.  ",
