There was a lot of grandstanding and the US won. We had the better team. Sullivan was nervous, Fitzpatrick was over matched against Zach Johnson, and Willett was a no show. Meanwhile Ryan Moore had a hot hand and plenty of motivation as a captains pick. Snedecker has a chip on his shoulder from his amateur days vis a vis international competition. And then there is Dustin Johnson, idling along in the ninth spot, which is at least five spots above his realistic world ranking. USA!",

And this type of match is a good start.<br/><br/>Reminds me of the comment from coach Al McGuire of Marquette when he was doing color commentary with Dick Enberg on a college basketball game. As a Freshman player was lining up an important free throw with thousands of fans from the opposing team yelling at him and making gestures to distract him, McGuire observed how different the staid game of golf was when crowds were instructed to remain quiet and still during their shots.<br/><br/>I've thought about that since and I must admit that the Ryder Cup is about the only golf match I'm interested in.

Anyways, I was there on Friday and Saturday and the boorish, loutish behavior was on full display from ALL generations - mainly males from their teens to \"men\" in their 60's. I am a millennial and I found the behavior absolutely disgusting, from spitting (why so much spitting people?), loudly passing gas, yelling insane comments and at really bad times, constantly chanting \"USA\" and acting like frat boys gone wild, regardless of age. A lot of people were wearing hockey and football jerseys, which, with their bellies hanging out, just seemed weird at a golf event. Some fun competitive ribbing is fine, but I was shocked to see such loutish behavior on shameless display from young and old.",
