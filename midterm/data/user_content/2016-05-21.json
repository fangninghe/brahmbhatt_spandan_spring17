Real tough guys don't constantly tell everyone around them how tough they are.  Everyone already knows.  <br/><br/>So the presidential race has come to this.  Who is the greatest phony playground bully.  Gosh, if America had only nominated Chris Christy, we could have had a real tough guy in the race.  Right. Sure.  Or maybe the guy from Texas with the boots.  What was his name?  I forgot already.  But he wore cowboy boots.  Oh yeah, he shot a critter once.    <br/><br/>So why are we giving a voice to Little Lord Fauntleroy?  We are giving him power by paying such close attention to him.  He is nonstop incredulous and the constant coverage actually gives his nonsense credibility.<br/><br/>Hillary should tell Richie Rich to go home and play with his toy friends that he bought at the clubhouse.  She should tell the GOP to send her a real man to run against.  I'd rather vote for John Wayne.  At least could he pull it off.                           ",

				"commentBody": "This is so deeply disturbing.  There is so much going on here.  I grew up with a sister who had mental illness which included aggressive, violent episodes.  When they occurred, we had to call the police for help because when she was psychotic she had massive strength and shocking abandon.  A rational person, who remains conscious of normal limits of behavior, is no match for someone in this state.  Eventually the police stopped responding when we called because they couldn't subdue her without getting extremely rough with her, and getting hurt themselves in the process, which embarrassed and enraged them.  I recognize that rage in the near-hysterial tone of the one deputy's voice here.<br/>As someone else posted here, it would make a lot more sense for police to have guns that delivered fast-acting tranquilizers than tazers.  How I wish something like that had existed 45 years ago when my family had to deal with this.  They did exist back then-- they were always used on \"Wild Kingdom\".  Was it the association with capturing wild animals that kept tranquilizer guns from being developed  for police use?  They would be much safer than tazers and also calm down people in those critical moments of close encounters with police.  And that would be safer for the police too.      ",

				"commentBody": ".<br/>I have shot rifles and shotguns, but this Reply isn't about me. It's about professionals:<br/><br/>Although Gerald Ford was President for only a couple of years, 2 different people are known to have tried to kill him. He was always accompanied by Secret Service agents; the agents were not only armed but were routinely tested for their marksmanship. This was, after all, barely a dozen years after our 4th Presidential assassination.<br/><br/>So what did the agents do when a would-be assassin pointed a firearm at Ford -- and pulled the trigger? They wrestled the miscreant to the ground. The phrase \"wrestled [someone/something] to the ground\" became a running joke during Chevy Chase's year on \"Saturday Night [Live]\".<br/><br/>Fast-forward a handful of years. President Reagan exits the Hilton in a crowd of Secret Service agents, DC police, and other security people. The Secret Service men were certainly armed.

				"commentBody": "Congestion pricing to make traffic flow freely at all hours would be a huge step in the right direction.  With free flowing traffic, places in the suburbs all of a sudden become \"closer\" to midtown by bus than some parts of Manhattan are now.  So overnight you might double the number of housing units within 30 minutes of midtown jobs.  The next thing would be to allow commuters to drive licensed 16 passenger minibuses on specific routes in poorly served areas for a $3 fare.  The labor, fuel and vehicle cost is near zero as this person was going to commute in anyway.  When he goes home at 5:30, he also picks up people on the route so he's always full.  A middle class office worker might get an extra $80 per day on the roundtrip for the same commute he would be doing anyway. Also minibus is the fastest and most comfortable way to commute. You don't have 20 people getting on and off at every stop.  The problem with public transit is that it's full on the way in to Manhattan at 8am but empty when it goes back out at 9 and still empty (or infrequent) for the rest of the day until 5.   So fuel economy is much lower than you would expect and labor cost much higher.  Sadly labor unions would nix such a plan.  Other countries have this ",

See my recommendation above.<br/><br/>There are different ways of looking at this recommendation, but the most basic is to regard it as the New York City's \"omnibus peak shaving\" concept.  The vans would serve peak shaving purposes, not only with helping serve the peak loads in the City's center during normal business hours, but would also serve the peak commuting loads from and to the City's center before and after normal business hours.<br/><br/>What makes it work in both cases is the use the smaller peak shaving units--vans--rather than the larger regular buses.  This van peak shaving capability would be completely under the control of and integrated with the City's intra and commuter bus systems.  The routes and operations would be franchises of the City's bus system.",

							"commentBody": "I have to sort of agree to this Kari.  If the subway riders really want good transit, they should be the ones paying for it, not those of us who have little or no access to it.  Some have to understand that MTA is collecting taxes from all over downstate NY, not just NYC itself.  Where's my mass transit?  Over in surrounding counties, the commuter trains and buses have sporadic schedules that can only work for those with regular work schedules, but if that's not the case, then you are better off driving.  Seriously, I'm getting tired of subway riders complaining about fare hikes when they are really the lowest among so many other hikes.  When tolls go up, they don't go up in quarters, they go up almost by an entire dollar or even more.  Another truth is here that transit is perversely funded by those with little or no access to it.  Before anyone says that driving is heavily subsidized by those who don't use that, it's actually not the case, because only the infrastructure that is being used is subsidized while the vehicles themselves aren't.  In other words, when I have to get my car serviced something of it renewed from the DMV, it doesn't come cheap and some of it has increased in the last decade as well.  Overall, I feel that a form of transit should be paid more proportionally to those that are using such a form the most, not the least.",

Here's the why I see it for those who take sides depending where they stand on the political spectrum.<br/><br/>Support and conservative: Believes that the market can be trusted to charge motorists when using the roads.<br/>Support and liberal: Believes that road pricing will be good for the environment as well as reducing traffic on roads.<br/>Oppose and conservative: Believes that the market can't be trusted especially in charging motorists to using the roads.<br/>Oppose and liberal: Believes that any form of road pricing is viewed as a regressive tax to lower classes that are being forced to drive when not having any other choices.",

The Triboro Rx sounds like a good idea, although someone irresponsibly built the bus terminal and took down the old New York, Westchester &amp; Boston viaduct south of E. 180th Street, which would have been a perfect route for the extended 2nd Avenue Subway and included part of the Triboro Rx. <br/><br/>But tolling into downtown, tolls on the intracity bridges and tunnels and congestion pricing will put a strain on occasional auto travelers from the suburbs as well as for city residents with limited mass transit or mobility issues (like stairs) who must drive between boroughs; their costs will rise. And I don't see Gov. Cuomo, a \"car guy,\" reacting positively to that - or to more trains, the latter to our detriment. In fact, look at a microcosm of his behavior as he and his surrogates have been party to the impending destruction of tourist railroads upstate which also have the potential for additional mass transit - the Catskill Mountain Railroad from Kingston to Phoenicia and Pine Hill and the Adirondack Scenic from Utica to Lake Placid - despite their success in bringing new tourism dollars to areas that need them. <br/><br/>More trains and subways? Yes. Congestion pricing and intracity tolls? I think there needs to be a different way to finance this plan.",

Ever since they have been used as a revenue source, they have gone up pretty constantly with some costing more than they should be.  Let's not forget that the other counties were promised that if they were to become boroughs of NYC, the tolls would eventually be removed, which is what had them originally opposed to the idea.  As matter of fact, placing the tolls for anything besides their intended purpose is what makes them so high in the first place.  I can still remember when I went around Florida and my family used the Florida Turnpike not that long ago and the tolls were only around a dollar, but up here, they are pretty pricey.  Another thing that gets me is that how is that the northeastern states have both the highest tolls and gas prices but the roads and highways are in such bad shape.  Where exactly is most of the money from the tolls even going to, because I don't think it's going where it's supposed to go?",

I believe that was LORRE's first English-language film, and rumor is that he learned his dialogue phonetically. Even so, he gives a deliciously mock-jolly-but-thoroughly-evil performance as the principal baddie. Leslie Banks was the titular MWKTM, while Edna Best gave a much shorter, crisper scream-that-saved-the-Ambassdor at the Albert Hall, as compared to Doris Day's longer, more piercing shriek in the 1956 version. Edna Best's character saves the day once again at the end of the film, while Banks' character is being held captive. No long creeping exit down a staircase, but an all out shoot-'em-up finale.<br/><br/>(I may have overspent my quota of hyphens in this post. If anyone has a few to spare, send them my way.)<br/><br/>Here's a clip from the Albert Hall concert scene, featuring Arthur Benjamin's \"Storm Cloud Canata.\" LORRE is seen briefly a couple of times listening over the radio.
