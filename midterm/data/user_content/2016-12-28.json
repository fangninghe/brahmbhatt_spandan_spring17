Given trump's track record, there's every reason to believe he is untrustworthy, so it's only appropriate that \"verify\" should come before \"trust\".  <br/><br/>I should not be surprised that you invoked the false equivalence of Vince Foster.  Nice try, though. Kellyanne Conway will be proud of you.",

				"commentBody": "Netanyahu is callously insulting and alienating the majority of Americans for his short term political gain - while his delusional supporters somehow imagine that Israel will be able to survive in the long run without the support of these very Americans. Perhaps everyone needs a reminder that it's not Trump who pays for Israel's defense, it's the American people. And the more Netanyahu throws tantrums when he doesn't get absolutely everything he wants from us the less likely we will be to oblige in the future. Not that he cares, but the people of Israel may one day pay horribly for his arrogance and disrespect towards the American people. As one who supports a secure and prosperous Israel, I hope I'm wrong. ",

The settlements constitute slow annexation. <br/><br/>And the fact of the matter is that the settlements have been a great success, at taking land and making peace increasingly inconceivable.  <br/><br/>That is Netanyahu's goal -- by making peace inconceivable there is no reason as the Israelis see it to halt the settlements. Take it all!  Of course where those pesky arabs go, is not a question Netanyahu will give an answer to.  One suspects he has one: a very ugly one. ",

Imagine if Gaza had a functioning air force continually invading and bombing Israel.<br/><br/>Once these facts are recognized, then we have to look for alternatives to a Palestinian state in the West Bank.  Because any self-government accommodations there won't ever really be a true country with full sovereignty.  <br/><br/>Of course, the Palestinians could look to Jordan for such a state.  Or perhaps the borders of Jordan, Syria, Egypt and Israel (and while we are at it, Iraq and Kurdistan) could be substantially redrawn with a Palestinian state in mind.  <br/><br/>I'm sure many people already know this, but it bears repeating because some people don't understand what a realistic two-state solution really means.  <br/><br/>So all this noise about the demise of the two-state solution is overblown:  the same watered down Palestinian \"state\" (read:  something less than the Vatican) remains achievable.  But the idea of a Palestinian state with full sovereignty is highly unrealistic unless the whole map of the Middle East is thrown out the window.    <br/><br/>*the above refers to the foreseeable future, i.e., the next 100 years.

Stop occasionally to observe something interesting.<br/>Repeat it in a different landscape.

However, while healthy eating can surely lead to the cessation of many meds, there are many drugs necessary for sustaining one's life for many reasons. You can't say there are no meds for serious conditions/diseases can't sustain human life. They are very necessary for many in order to do just that.<br/><br/>I've witnessed more than a few patients, including an otherwise very healthy, beautiful and vibrant young woman suffer the degradation of Parkinson's. Without the meds, she would have suffered and died a whole lot sooner than she did, which was entirely too soon as it was. They buy all of them more time, as well as being able to sustain some dignity along the way. ",

In some ways these patients are  examined almost as intensely as a patient trying to get on a kidney transplant list.<br/><br/>With the interest in a lucrative reimbursement in bariatric surgery, I think that some \"practitioners\" have minimized or skipped those aspects of the surgery that is dependent on the psychological needs and expectations of the patient. Bariatric surgery  was once seen as the \"last best chance\" for someone whose morbid obesity threatened their life to the same degree as cancer,stroke,liver cirrhosis and renal failure.<br/><br/>The reimbursement for bariatric surgery has allowed some practitioners to focus on the benefit to their financial situation,as opposed to the evaluation of the impact and \"success\" on the patient.<br/><br/>This state of affairs is a uniquely American problem.Countries with rational health care systems, rarely see physicians with a \"what is it worth to me,rather than what is the best outcome for my patient\". If you cut enough corners in patient screening you can boost the first outcome (personal,financial),at the expense of the second (patient).",

				"commentBody": "Wonderful article about bariatric surgery...but it didn't answer the big question it exposed at the end of the article.    Why are those so unhappy after transforming their life for the better?  Why are 100 million obese Americans so apprehensive about bariatric surgery that only 1 in 80 of eligible patients have gotten it?<br/><br/>As the article points out, the surgery drastically and permanently changes  the hunger hormones that drive obesity.   The problem is many of these same factors contribute to happiness.  <br/><br/>Drug makers for years have been trying to make psychiatric medication that causes a positive effect but doesn't cause obesity.   Its proven to be very elusive.  And, blocking pleasurable hormones associated with obesity such as cannabis, the active ingredient in Marijuana, makes things worse.  The blocking cannabis caused weight loss; however, it also caused severe anxiety, depression, and a doubling of the rate of suicide.<br/><br/>Bariatric surgery also changes the  hormones that have a profound effects on emotions. So much, that  80-85% of patients divorce within two years after surgery, alcoholism &amp; substance abuse all of a sudden develops or worsens after surgery, depression and anxiety spiral out of control, suicide rates dramatically increase, especially in men (800%).<br/><br/>The big questions aren't answered yet.  Is Jessica's life better now that she dropped out of college?  She sounds anxious &amp; depressed?  How will her bariatric physician help her? What happens next?",
