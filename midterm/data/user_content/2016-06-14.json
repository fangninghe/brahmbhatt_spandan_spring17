I've never actually been hit on by a gay man other than at an all men's hot spring. <br/><br/>What mystifies me is why anybody cares who else is using the same restroom?",

				"commentBody": "As someone who bought the house I needed (rather than the max I could afford), I was frustrated by the small amount of tax deduction it gave me. Basically, the bulk of the mortgage deduction was one I could have had anyway by using the standard deduction. I eventually decided to cash in stock and pay off the house, and have taken the standard deduction ever since. Most homeowners who itemize don't realize that the big beneficiaries are really the rich with the million dollar homes that are reaping most of the federal subsidy. If we made it a standard amount for each family (instead of basing it on the size of your house), it would be fairer, and less of a subsidy to the rich. But they have the power, so don't expect it to change without a big political fight. One that the banks and realtors will be happy to fight on behalf of their rich customers. ",

The most interesting aspect I haven't seen commented on anywhere was that it was primarily women heartlessly controlling the rules on both sides--the couples and the loners.  The men are obedient.    And the punishment which is inflicted on Weisz is not surprising, in terms of the viciousness women can inflict on each other in real life under the guise of concern, when it's really all about control.  While I see by reviews that some viewers were appalled and disturbed by the ending, I have to say, it is only a movie and the sacrifice suggested is not very different from some of the fairy tales I grew up hearing.<br/>I wish more had been made of the turning into an animal premise.  As it was used in the movie it just seems like an off-camera plot gimmick but not used to any meaningful effect in the story.  I did notice a camel strolling through the woods, but that was it.  Also, the idea of being single meaning you will one day choke to death eating alone was a very funny running joke in 30 Rock several years ago.",
