Today, those who used to be and aren't in the middle class any longer, comprise a huge segment of the population, added to those who were already on the margins.",

We tried to drive up the one-car-wide concrete strip of road that led to the crest of the volcano, passing by small farms and tiny houses, all with goats roaming about.  About 2/3s of the way up, I noticed bulges in the hillside with steam/smoke drifting out.  I felt as if the ground under us was volatile, and insisted we turn around and get back to Plymouth.  We have a little print of a primitive painting that depicts downtown Plymouth with its bright colored shops, pleasant people, and bustling street life.  It's sad to look at the photos and see the ghost town that Plymouth now is.  All the best to the people of Montserrat as they try to rebuild their lives and communities.",

But as someone who has been both fat and at his ideal weight, I beg to disagree with your assertion that there is anything good about obesity.

And it's a fairly miserable state to be in, making everyday tasks difficult to accomplish and leading to joint problems, back problems, and other issues that can be crippling.<br/><br/>Should we be rude or inconsiderate to overweight people? Of course not.

				"commentBody": "How many readers are old enough to remember when a few times a year, one went to a very nice local restaurant, had a very nice meal with good service and wine, and had no idea how many \"stars\" it had (probably none) and as a diner, one had no idea the name of the chef.  One went because the Steak Diane or the Shrimp Scampi was reliably good. One didn't expect something new - in fact, most people didn't like anything other than a few minor seasonal menu changes.  It was a splurge, but dinner for 4 was not more than most people's mortgage payments.<br/><br/>Who was the chef?  Often a nice Frenchman who went home, fixed himself an omelet and went to bed. He loved cooking but had no expectation of fame and fortune.  If he owned the restaurant, most likely his wife ran the front of the house.  It was not architecturally grand or cutting edge, just a pleasant place to spend a couple of hours with good friends and good food.<br/><br/>The wait staff was often foreign - usually men - who earned enough to support their family.  When dinner was over, they went home, not out to party.<br/><br/>It's a different world today.  Young chefs want celebrity.  They are not satisfied to merely master the Larousse Gastronomic (few even try) but want to come up with some odd concoction that will have the foodies swooning.  The wait staff are young and spend most of their night's tips on booze and drugs when they leave work.

				"commentBody": "I agree that it is necessary to do everything possible to decrease the amount of lead exposure in our environment. But I do have a question, which in the case of Flint, has not been clearly addressed. The lead pipes in Flint - are they on the city side of the water meters or are they on the house side of the water meters? Clearly, the city of Flint has an obligation to deliver safe water to the meter, but what level of obligation do they have if the lead pipes are on the house side of the meter? Of course, now we know that a serious problem exists, we as a country have an obligation to address the problem as rapidly and completely as possible regardless of where the lead pipes are. But I think the location of the lead pipes goes to the question of the degree of criticism to which the city and state officials should be subjected.",

But no one was willing to spend the $$.  Imagine this happening in Grosse Pointe or any other wealthy suburb of Detroit.  Hmmm........",

Then there are those who think for themselves and have values that span the blurred lines and they are looking for someone like a Reagan or even a Clinton (Bill) to bring the country together. Unfortunately there isn't a single candidate in this entire race that can get anywhere close and that is sad for this great country. I predict another 4-8 year stupid contest awaits us and all of the pathetic posturing that goes with it.",
