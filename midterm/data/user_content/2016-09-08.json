I have heard her various reasons, which all seem pretty weak, but accusing Colin Powell of advising her to do it is really sort sophomoric.  I did it because someone else told me to, even when the State Department told me not to.  Please, talk about spinning and spinning.  Her prevarications make one dizzy.",
