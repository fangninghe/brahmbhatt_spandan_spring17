							"commentBody": "Folks need to stop trying to preserve  Prince's pattern of unhealthy secrets, it is such a disservice. If Judith Hill was not in the plane Prince would have died in the air.  If Prince were not left alone on April 21 he probably would still be alive. And he would have been challenged by knowing everyone would know his best kept secret: an addiction to drugs, whatever the reason - a chink in the armor, information that could not be controlled. And I am sure those folks who are clamoring about this article would be the least supportive and most critical of his difficult path recovery from drug use and the obvious humiliation Prince would have suffered through.  Leave Judith Hill alone.  Prince's great artistry and humanity is in tact.  Appreciate the truth: Prince was human and he suffered and he is not suffering anymore.  Love Prince more than the secrets that contributed to his death.",

				"commentBody": "I had the luxury of coming out in college. However, when I went to law school and passed the Bar, non-average sex practices were considered \"moral turpitude\" and could bar a person from law practice! I had dated a much older man during that time, and when classmates thought he was my uncle, we both smiled and kept silent.<br/>Since those days, many attorneys have revealed a moral turpitude far worse than alternate sex practices--embezzlement of clients' funds or, if the attorneys take to politics, starting wars based on lies to enrich themselves and blocking any and all attempts to control gun carnage.<br/>I'm glad I've been true to myself, and it's now possible for more and more of us to do so. As FDR said, \"There's nothing to fear but fear itself,\" to which I'll add that the people who traffic in fear are usually hiding either their greed or their horizontal desires.",

The science is staring us in the face today already, and we will not be forgiven. And it will be another nail in the coffin of these retrograde Dark Ages religions that promote homophobia.",

As and if we understand being LGBT is genetic, it will be possible through genetic editing to remove that gene, or through some other way prevent that birth.  I don't see much change for today's rampant ignorant definition of \"others\" as \"others\" unless tolerance is based on genuine understanding of diversity.  We don't have religious tolerance because people are born a certain religion, and they just can't help themselves.  \"Born this way\" is a very well intentioned, but morally insufficient argument in the face of emerging science, and receding religion.  We must teach the value of \"god's\" or \"nature's\" diversity in and of itself.",

His legion of fans and peers recognize Prince as a consummate artist, performer, musician, bandleader, and lyricist/poet. A shame you are only aware of his most popular though lesser work from thirty years ago. Please go back to enjoying your dinosaur rock or speed metal or whatever soothes your narrow mind and myopic heart, instead of espousing your totally uninformed opinion on the NYTs.",

				"commentBody": "Suzanne ,<br/>Your assertion that increasing amounts of opiates are needed to garner the same effect is not always true . I am 64 and have had chronic back pain since I was 27 . I had to begin taking Vicodin daily in 1992 , almost 25 years ago . Now , as then , I take 4 to 5 per day . I do not crave the drug and only have to increase the dosage or switch to oxycodone ( Vicodin is hydrocodone w/ Tylenol ) once or twice a year for a few weeks if one of my disc herniates . Opiates can be used safely and effectively , and I am sick and tired of the media and other know - it - alls always stating the opposite . It is precisely because of this misinformation that doctors are now paranoid to treat chronic pain patients and our family doctors have driven us to pain management doctors ( if there are any in your area ! ) where you pee into a little jar every month and spend thousands of dollars per year for basically no reason .",

Forgetting that you already took your dose and subsequently you decide to take a second dose (i.e. accidentally taking a double dose) can kill you. A forgetful mistake can kill you with this drug. You will know if someone you know is abusing to Fentanyl. They will likely be incoherent or unconscious. This isn't a drug that's very easy to fake being clean or not addicted.",
