				"commentBody": "Thank you. I have been writing to newspapers about this issue for decades and they still fail to properly report it. It's of the utmost importance for journalists to do their research and not become propaganda mouthpieces for governments and demagogues.  <br/><br/>It's disturbing to read lines such as \"in 1949, when Taiwan split from China\".  As you point out, the KMT, led by the brutal dictator Chiang Kai-Shek, split from China and fled to Taiwan then. The Taiwanese people were already there and had a separate identity. What followed was decades of oppression, brutality, and attempts to wipe out their culture. <br/><br/>In dealing with an issue that so many Americans seem in the dark about, it would behoove the Times to write an article discussing this history. In an era of fake news and poor awareness of facts, journalists from all outlets should heed this call to inform the public of the real story.",

				"commentBody": "As a young Taiwanese myself who participated the Sunflower Movement, I believe Taiwanese identity and economy are both the reasons why so many young people join the movement. <br/><br/>Service industrial workforce in Taiwan which would be impacted greatly by the service trade pact is consisted about 70% of total workforce, and the former government could not provide reasonable supporting measures for the impacts. This is unquestionable the main motivation behind the majority who join the movement. <br/><br/>However, Taiwanese identity is definitely another drive behind the movement. Ever since former President Ma won the election back in 2008, the pride of Taiwanese people had been trampled underfoot by both China and KMT governments. Can you imagine that you are not allowed to show your national flag on your own soil? But yes, this kind of incidents happened not just once, but numerous times back in 2008~2014. Of course many Taiwanese will be agitated by such insults.<br/><br/>Last but not least, I don't think DDP had anything to do with  Sunflower movement... Just look at the largest and most successful protest organized by DPP at its prime back in 2005 against the anti-secession law, there are only 270 thousand protesters in Taipei City, but on March-30 rally during Sunflower movement, there are more than 400-500 thousand people. Just please don't get confused between political hitchhiking and masterminding...",

				"commentBody": "That the US's vaunted \"exceptionalism\" is in decline is indisputable. The tragedy, sadly, is that it's avoidable. America continues to confound observers in her penchant for self-destruction. \"A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself within\".<br/>\tBy abandoning the core values of \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\" for ALL, as envisioned by her Founding Fathers, she\u2019s unwittingly undermined her legitimacy. Power without legitimacy is tyranny. And increasingly, this has come to characterise America for many through her role in myriad geopolitical conflicts, recurrent global financial crises, impoverishment of her own citizens, gross inequality, rampant individualism/Darwinism, corruption and unrestrained greed as epitomised by corporations, etc.<br/>\tOminously, the recent outrageous elections in America may hasten her demise. China understands that anarchy/partisanship diminishes nationhood. Contrast this to the solidarity and focus of the CCP, \"elected\" or not.<br/>\tTo remain relevant, and perhaps regain her clout on the global stage, America must champion justice for ALL, domestically and internationally, by re-embracing the principles of \"the common good\" and \u201clive and let live\u201d. Thus respect is won.<br/>\tShe can\u2019t bully her way to prominence. That era is gone! Obama understands this, hence his foreign policy strategy of seeking strength by promoting respect for others, without blunting the aura of America\u2019s military might. ",

The only candidate who offered us a choice to stop this madness was Trump.  <br/><br/>Manufacture here where rules are tougher and wages are higher.  Get rid of the ridiculously nonsensical regulations.  Meanwhile, prices will increase slightly.  Consumers will pay more, but only what the market will bear.  Corporations will be forced to roll back CEO pay.  Inequality will lessen, which will burst the luxury bubble that drives up all costs.  <br/><br/>Jeb and Hillary's business as usual will never be an option for career, self-serving politicians again.
