				"commentBody": "I'm not arguing for complacency, but our current measures are extraordinary by any measure. We cannot let a single attack in Belgium, probably the most vulnerable state in Europe, dictate major security decisions and long-term strategy in the US. Our challenges are totally unique: An ocean separates us from Middle East conflicts, so we do not have droves of returning foreign fighters. We do monitor our borders - not perfectly, but they are nowhere near as porous as European nations. Our intelligence network and investment in homeland security dwarfs that in any other country on the planet; hundreds of Belgian professionals do the job that many thousands perform in the US and abroad. Take a look at the screening process for Syrian refugees relocating to the US, and tell me that it's anywhere NEAR as lax as refugee policies in Europe.<br/><br/>Our security policies since 2001 have either prevented or foiled every major organized terror plot involving foreign attackers. Conversely, we have demonstrated time and time again that we are vulnerable to radicalized lone-wolves already on our soil. Security measures that promote further radicalization will do more to hinder our goals than advance them.",

Xenophobia, arrogance, closed borders - none of these things promote the good will required for these partnerships.<br/>2) Terrorism is a hydra: cut off one head, and two will replace it. It is no single group or state, and radical ideologies will flourish as long as conditions allow. I'm not so hopelessly naive that I would suggest that being nice will keep us safe, but positive relations with Muslim people and governments must be a component of our long-term strategy.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem like many people agree with me today...

				"commentBody": ".<br/>I find myself in agreement with Art Kraus and -- possibly a first -- the Canadian duo of Robert and Robert (at least one of whom has a doctorate).<br/><br/>Mr./Dr. Kraus, you may submit a correction for photo captions any time they appear. Wordplay photo captions are corrected every now and then, although the only important one involved a photo of Brett Favre a few days after the Jets signed him.<br/><br/>I would submit the correction myself, but for the fact that I believe the Corrections Desk ignores my emails by now. They are not alone. I was flipping through the Pulitzer Prize website of an afternoon, trying to learn why there is no prize for crossword commentary, when I happened upon a photo with an inaccurate caption. I called in to the office at the journalism school that handles such matters, and reported the error. The person on the phone said she would inform \"the tech\". So a year later, I learned that the person in the photo was the top editor of a major paper. I checked the Pulitzer site to see if the photo was still there. It was, with the inaccurate caption. So I telephoned the major paper. I asked the person on the other end whether she would be able to transmit info to the editor. When she said yes, I gave her the URL of the photo and asked her to do whatever she wished with the information. It was, after all, her boss in the photo, not me.<br/><br/>Five hours later, I checked the photo. The caption had been fixed.<br/><br/>Robert &amp; Robert: Thank you for the new phrase!  \"Sun dog.\"",

				"commentBody": "There is an excellent website called <a href=\"http://sourdo.com\" title=\"sourdo.com\" target=\"_blank\">sourdo.com</a> which sells sourdough cultures from all over the world.  I use the one they got from a centuries old bakery on the Island of Ischia in Italy, and it makes great Italian bread and pizza that tastes like the stuff you get in Naples (I also use an oven that gets un to 900 degrees go it bakes in a few minutes the way they do it there).  This is a sourdough which is not very sour.  When on vacation in Brazil I have started my own culture by simply putting out a flour and water mixture out on the windowsill until it starts to bubble, and I made some tremendous bubbly focaccia using this culture.  <a href=\"http://Sourdo.com\" title=\"Sourdo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sourdo.com</a> was started by a pathologist who became interested in and collecting ancient sourdough cultures, and he also has a book which explains how to maintain and \"wash\" your cultures, and which has many recipes.  One thing I learned from him is that activating your culture before you use it gives the best results- so take a cup out of your mother culture from the refrigerator, add a cup of flour and a half cup of spring or distilled (NOT city tap water), mix it and let it rise at room temperature (or a little higher if possible - 75-80 degrees) until it rises and froths (and it may overflow your bowl)- at that point the culture is maximally active, and if you use it to make dough it will cause it to rise very briskly and make great bread.",

							"commentBody": "The only thing I can suggest is making sure you are proofing at an adequate temperature.   Some ovens have a proofing mode, where the temperature is around 80 degrees.  You can also build a proofing box by using a low wattage light bulb with a dimmer switch and thermometer in a styrofoam container, and trying to proof at higher temperatures- experiment from 75-90 degrees.  When I made my own local sourdough starter in Brazil the temperature was probably in the 80s or higher which is one reason it did so well.  A room temperature of 68 or even 72 is too low to really get cultures fully activated.  When you activate your culture you should see it rise \"exponentially\" as it rises and bubbles up and peaks then starts shrinking down as it starts to run out of the sugar needed for growing with the shortest doubling time.",

							"commentBody": "I was wondering if that guy was still around (at Sourdoughs International)! <br/><br/>I bought, via mail order in the late '80s, three of the packaged starters as offered by Sourdoughs International. Of the two starters I've still got going, one is the Russian starter offered on the <a href=\"http://sourdo.com\" title=\"sourdo.com\" target=\"_blank\">sourdo.com</a> website from that initial order. The other is a recipe using Champagne grapes I got from Steve Singleton's method as described in \"Chez Panisse Cookbook,\" by Alice Waters. <br/><br/>I agree with both the article and commenters that started adopt and adapt to local ingredients and atmosphere. I must say, that my two starters, although fed from the same trough, bear distinct qualities: one is sweet and mildly sour, the other quite pungent and bolder (the Russian).<br/><br/>-- Randy",
