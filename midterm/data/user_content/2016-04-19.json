				"commentBody": "I have to say that the ACA has provided some needed changes to coverage, including more options for the indigent and no longer denying people with pre-existing conditions coverage oronly offering exorbitantly priced coverage. There also are people who are able to orchestrate low annual incomes to qualify for inexpensive ACA plans despite being asset rich, but they are the exception. <br/><br/>There is further good news that overall health care costs have increased minimally for ACA insurance during the past 2-3 years. BUT, that\u2019s where it ends. <br/><br/>During the 2014-16 period my annual insurance premiums - admittedly offered by my company as a retiree benefit - have gone up 25%-25%-20% annually while out-of-pocket maximums have risen substantially. However, to purchase a comparable plan via my state's Healthcare exchange, the cost would be 80% + more.<br/><br/>I don't want you to think I am complaining, but it is a canard to say that Obamacare is going to cost less. The fact is, the costs have been shifted elsewhere in the system so insurers can be made whole.<br/><br/>We may find at some point in the future that by covering more people and helping those needing medical care get their medical issues and recommended lifestyle changes addressed to ensure better overall health, the cost of health care may, in fact, drop substantially for society.",

				"commentBody": "I was kicking myself when the S of \"elis\" was my last square to fill, and I saw what was meant. This because, while I worked on my first grad degree, Jodie Foster was in residence across the street as one of a few rather famous undergrads (Superman's little brother Joe was there, too); and when I picked up my terminal degree, Ms. Streep was picking up her honorary doctorate. We marched only a few dozen people apart. She was quite pregnant at the time, and radiant was the only way to describe her. Still, as MTF implies, Yale was incredibly stingy with both \"Eli\" and \"Yalie,\" along with membership in Mory's, reserving them only to undergraduates in Yale College. Yale has since repented of these positions to the point of spreading the ill-considered story that it was never so (this sentiment has even appeared in the \"independent\" alumni magazine). Anyway, I wish wish wish Eli did not appear so frequently in these puzzles, or if it must, if it could every once in a while be a Hebrew prophet.<br/><br/>BTW, MTF, that would be the School of Forestry and Environmental Studies (FES), est. 1900. During the 80s and 90s, the Dean of FES had a voice that was extremely deep and booming and that voice, combined with his grizzled looks, earned him a huge cheer every year at graduation when he presented the candidates to the President for their degrees.",

And, unlike his opponent, he has very high positives and low negatives, plus polls better than she does beating any of the Republicans running.  Plus, high turnout favors the Democratic Party- the enthusiasm is with Bernie, not Clinton.  Feel the Bern!",

They provide demo services, harvest everything recyclable, charge the developer a fee and then issues the developer a charity deduction. <br/><br/>Most of us here for any time would prefer that Portland was the sleepy midsize town we came to  fifteen years ago for a genuine frisson of cool, very affordable housing, and a culture of civilized hedonism (in the very broad sense of enjoyment). Now rising RE values are creating a bonanza for an insurgent class of migrant workers distinct from the so called creative class celebrated only one decade ago. The new employees of startups founded here or moving here can be seen crowding the chic watering holes in newly-densified neighborhoods on Monday night.

							"commentBody": "A couple of years ago, an illegal family of Mexicans moved into our neighborhood. This was unusual as we have no local hispanic population and are 1200 miles from the Mexican border. However, we welcomed them (not knowing their illegal status nor asking about it). They were sweet and friendly, as photogenic as the family in the recent article here about illegal families hoping to take advantage of President Obama's despicable edict....there were married parents, a sweet old grandma and 5 cute children ages 5-12.<br/><br/>One night, we awoke to the sound of sirens and police cars. They were at the home rented by the Mexican family. Turned out, the adults in the family (yes, even granny!) were directly involved in the drug trade. The house was chockfull of drugs and I do NOT mean \"a few marijuana plants\". They had cocaine, heroin, Oxycontin and worse there. They were dealing to the kids in our neighborhood. The home was a locus for drug crime, and also fencing stolen goods.<br/><br/>And as I said: this was an adorable family with cute kids. Face it, anyone who would steal into a foreign country IS A CRIMINAL. They all need to be deported and ASAP.",

Then back to the studio for some innuendo. What was kind of strange is that the reporters ventured to Budapest to visit the inventor and get his show-and-tell, yet they didn't bother with a test drive of the bike equipped with the super-expensive electromagnetic rear wheel. Instead, we see Contador's mechanic, his Bluetooth wristband and antics.",

Next thing, they'll be introducing a new version that thwarts all the detection approaches, for an additional $15k. <br/><br/>That said, I'm glad this technology is being developed. I rode a friend's assist bike in Kyoto, just a family bike with a child seat. It was great. I plan to get an electric bike at some point in the not too distant future, and hopefully there will be technological trickle-down. <br/><br/>But the idea that these bike systems that are hidden are anything other than a cheater's paradise is crazy.
