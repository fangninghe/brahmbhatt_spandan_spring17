I just figured we'd be getting an outline of 39D.<br/><br/>It's got the Chicago connection, and you could still used the phrase \"one of my favorites\". Speaking of favorites, I've of course been reading a lot about actors of bygone days, meandering through anecdotes. Learned that Henry Fonda didn't miss a single performance when he starred in Mister Roberts on Broadway. Even when his wife died. He showed up in the wings that night, in costume, a minute before curtain; walked right past his understudy (who of course was also in costume) and onto the stage.<br/><br/>If you want suejean to have a better shot, I think you should stick closer to the theme and also use \"favourites\". Speaking of suejean, the groups arguing over Brexit called a cease-fire on campaigning after that MP was killed in Yorkshire. That's class.",

				"commentBody": "These refusals to protect the American public from social violence like the civilized western European nations have protected their publics including Japan, Australia and New Zealand is more than cowardice, it cynical and calculated. Our great leaders have chosen, both Dems and Repubs, to destabilize American society by flooding it with weapons, just as they've done in what used to be called \"third world countries\",  to divide and conquer those nations and now its our turn American People. Not only that, we've become the world's greatest jailer at the same time, worse than China and Russia combined. We jail more people than any country in the world and have the highest violent crime rate of all the so-called Western Democracies. Darn, now that's something to be proud of America, isn't it? <br/><br/>Our Congress, Courts including the SCOTUS, and Chief Executives regardless of their party affiliation are in contempt of the American People. Isn't it time we approach World Organizations for help to deal with our internal violence problem as our leaders are not helping us out at all on the societal violence thing are they? Something stinks.<br/><br/>What happened in Florida was grotesque, the media cashing in on the atrocity by splashing the whole sorry spectacle all over the news 24/7 was just as sickening, kids can be nowhere near a TV in today's America. And our great elected officials do nothing and keep stirring the pot. Where are you Obama and the Justice Department when America needs you? ",

Did you pay with a credit card? Look on your VISA or M/C statement. Do you buy ammunition at Cabelas? You're probably on their mailing list. If you belong to the NRA, believe me, they've got a list; they want to send you the monthly subscription to their publication and offer you discounts on various products. (They'd probably like a donation for their lobbying efforts, also.)<br/><br/>I mean, any list can be subpoenaed or hacked. Granted it's not like the government has an easy one-stop-shopping list of gun owners. But really, who owns guns is not generally much of a secret anyway. Most gun owners like to talk about their firearms.<br/><br/>Joe, you sound really reasonable. But if these rapid-fire guns proliferate in the general population, the price will drop. Imagine gangs with these things. It'll be guerilla war for somebody like me to walk to the grocery store. I don't want to carry a gun. We're kind of in this together. What can we do?",
