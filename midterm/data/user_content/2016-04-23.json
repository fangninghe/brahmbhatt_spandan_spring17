				"commentBody": "Why are more people here killing themselves? Very likely because they have the bad luck to live in a country that views people as basically disposable, less important than money or property, and has allowed policies that reward employers for working those they hire 24/7/365 if possible (That 'exempt employees' yearly salary system is one of the worst abuses you can imagine.) Not only that, just consider what it takes to even have a shot at getting a job, especially in any place that's considered a 'trendy' or 'hip' youth magnet - a conforming extrovert's social media profile and even a gym-toned physique, as well as the ability to psych out those mumbo-jumbo online 'personality' tests so loved by so many bosses these days. To that, add the relentless propaganda barrage that keeps telling us that there is basically no such thing as a stable career and that we'll all have to spend our lives competing and conforming to avoid ending up starving amongst the homeless. Frankly, the current situation in America is making George Orwell look like an OPTIMIST. It's also an insane recipe for social discord. At least in the Euro Zone, where wage-hours laws eliminate the 'exempt' loophole and such matters as social media and even your charge card purchases are off-limits to employers, they still hire mere human beings and don't let their unemployed citizens starve in the streets. So how long will we tolerate what's basically become a heartless society that outdoes the world of Dickens? ",

But over the last couple of decades worker protections and pay have eroded in my area of expertise. <br/><br/>I wish I could stick around, I want to live even if I am in physical pain, but I don't want to be sick and homeless. So in a few months I will take a one way flight to Switzerland as a suicide tourist. It isn't what I really want, it's simply the best of many bad options.",

I used to be an oxycontin addict, and when I quit I met sooooo many seniors who were addicted to pain medicine until they died. They would be in a fog, not really living life, just waiting for the end to come. I'd rather live my life as healthy and addiction-free as I can, and if the pain ever becomes too much, I think I'd probably end it. Doctors want to think they can give us options to live forever, but in reality we cannot. Opiates are the worst medicine on planet earth. Try CBD, all natural and very effective for chronic pain while not being addictive and evil :-)",
