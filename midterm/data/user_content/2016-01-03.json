The flaw in our emphasis on a perfect string of high grades is that your mistakes are what you learn from! (Do you watch Jeopardy? I do. Years later, I remember the answers to Final Jeopardy questions I got wrong.) Wrong answers tell you what you need to learn; figuring out why your answer was wrong teaches you.  A perfect grade tells you nothing but what you already know. An endless series of 100s and A+s on tests means your child is learning nothing, treading water in the shallows. ",

Why should a woman's sabbatical for any of those reasons should not be permitted as a basis for qualifying for a position. Asking an employee to account for any unemployment time should be only be considered when the reason is anything other than the said above. Reasons like, I wanted to travel, I felt the need for time off, or I just wanted a break could be reasons to consider their employability.

				"commentBody": "These posts demonstrate how pervasive and destructive age discrimination has become.  Why don't we hear more about these pernicious practices and their victims?  One reason:  gag provisions in separation contracts.<br/><br/>To obtain their severance and benefits, employees are forced to sign contracts in which they promise not to disclose the terms of their settlements and, further, not to \"disparage\" their former employers.  Disparagement doesn't merely mean defamation; the employees give up the right to criticize their employer in any way that might harm his business, a provision that is broadly interpreted to include all comments regarding what the employee may have believed to be illegal discrimination.  Moreover, the contracts also contains provisions that declare, in advance, that any breach of the agreement will \"irreparably harm\" (a legal term) the employee.  The employee is effectively silenced by such contracts.<br/><br/>First, gag orders and non-disparagement clauses should be nullified as coercive. Even when represented by counsel, employees usually have no choice but to sign, because they need severance pay and medical benefits. The provisions are one-sided, and unfair.<br/><br/>Second, such clauses should be declared void as a matter of public policy. As these posts demonstrate, we need to hear from victims -- and from one another -- that age discrimination is pervasive, pernicious and deadly.  We cannot address the issues if everyone is blackmailed into shutting up. ",

				"commentBody": "We are living in a society that values youth, beauty and money above all else.  And this goes big time for the workplace, too.  Blame it on the worship of the celebrity culture and all that comes with it.  Turn on the TV and that's what is there.  How many advertisements in the media do we see for plastic surgery?   How many of our doctors are plastic surgeons vs. general practitioners?  There's big money to be made in plastic surgery.  Not so much for general practitioners.  Unfortunately, women 50 and over are seen as \"throw-aways.\" A wrinkle here and there.  Perhaps a little overweight.  Why do you see so many trying to look young?  Try the dating scene where youth and beauty reign supreme.  We are bombarded every day with images of impossible physical ideals and youthful perfection.  So, in summary, when you add this societal discrimination to the mix of bottom-line corporate profits, technological change and post-recession downsizing attitudes, you've got one hekkuva problem and a very scary future for our country.  If we stay on this current path, you will see poverty and pestilence that will rival any Dickens novel.",

Some employers are unfortunately looking for applicants with less experience who they see as easier to train and transition into their workplace culture. Experience is looked upon now as being \"stubborn\" and/or \"set in your ways\". My siblings and I have supported my mother through this period as she continues to look for employment. She has taken temp positions as well as retail positions working weekends,holidays and sometimes until 2am, just to make ends meet. I will continue to support my mother until she is back in the workforce but employers need to do a better job at recruiting not only college graduates but also experienced workers who are looking to return to the workforce.",
