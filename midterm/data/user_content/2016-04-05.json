				"commentBody": "There are many reasons to convert a single image to a pdf before transmitting it.  (Of course, if you're trying to combine multiple images into a single page, pdf will be the only natural choice.)<br/><br/>I email a lot of images and almost always burn pdfs.  The resolution you select will not be tampered with, and it will look the same on any device its displayed or printed on.  A bitmap format like jpg will render differently on devices with different natural resolutions.<br/><br/>Many professional printers use pdf internally and produce optimal, predictable results when fed pdf.  <br/><br/>Of course pdf supports documents of arbitrary complexity, but using pdf for a single image is common and certainly a best practice.  <br/><br/>This notion that this clue, which has appeared in many crosswords from many publishers, is incorrect is not right.  Sorry.",

Instead of (as Bittman notes) thinking about, and engaging with, the food we eat, instead we have paid someone else to take that trouble.<br/><br/>I don't begrudge those who find this a relief to the challenge of cooking 7 nights a week, nor those who simply need some adjunct to help them build confidence in the kitchen; but let's not lose sight of the fact that this is a privileged means to a pampered end, and one which strips us of an integral aspect of how we relate to what we eat.",

As Cruz appositely points out, Kasich can't even get any Republicans to vote for him. He certainly wouldn't get any Democratic votes in the general election. If Kasich somehow became the Republican nominee (which is virtually impossible), the media would actually publicize his record and that myth the he's a \"moderate\" would be immediately exposed for the fabrication it is which would rule out votes from independents. That leaves pretty much nobody at all supporting Kasich.",
