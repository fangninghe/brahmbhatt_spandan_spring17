				"commentBody": "I was a Lamborghini kid-- I constantly took off so swiftly and without warning that ultimately my parents put me on a harness and a leash, and my mother had to endure passers-by commenting, \"That's a child, not a dog.\"  But if she hadn't done that, I'm almost certain I would have been seriously injured or killed at some point, and yes, possibly caused an accident affecting others.  My mom had four other kids to watch.  But here is the thing-- fairly early on my parents realized they had to take extra measures with me, and I'm pretty sure if we were at the zoo and I had said anything about crawling over a fence, both of them would have been all over me.  And there's something I've been trying to figure out here-- one story I read said the father was at the zoo with the mother, but she is the one everyone is so viciously attacking--perhaps because her voice can be heard. I think she said exactly the right thing to keep the child calm.  \"I'm here.  Mommy loves you.\"<br/>Anyway, I've come to believe zoos reflect an archaic mindset, no matter how lush the enclosures become.  Animals, especially the large, intelligent mammals, do not belong on display in captivity for our amusement.",

				"commentBody": "There is no surprise here.  Students with Pell grants mostly comes from low income families and tend to be less than prepared for college.  The question that must be asked is why more and more students with these backgrounds are choosing to go to college and most would fail to graduate and be burdened with crushing debts.  These students and their families have no choice but to gamble with college and debts because manufacturing, semi-skilled, blue collars middle class jobs have largely disappeared from the American economy.  Tax policies have failed to re-distribute income in terms of social benefits such as job training, childcare, healthcare, and K-12 education and thus exacerbated wage stagnation and income inequality.  Attending college regardless of capability to learn and pay has become the only avenue for low income students and their families to climb the economic and income ladder.  ",

				"commentBody": "I disagree. I was the first in my family to attend college.  I had no help to prepare me for any facet of college life, and I attended a selective private school.  Once in college there were no remedial classes, and there shouldn't be, that's not what college is for. If you need remedial classes you have no business being in college, period. Go back to high school or community college and work harder. I worked like a dog in college, with two reading- and writing- intensive majors and a foreign language minor, in the era where papers still needed to be written on typewriters...much more labor intensive.  I got a few bad grades as a freshman, but I plowed on. Dropping out was not something I ever considered.  I am amazed at the lack of resilience of today's generation, where transferring and dropping out are the first responses to adversity.  Today plenty of schools have watered down the requirements for a degree.  A college degree is easy to get, but a college education is still hard to earn...it only comes after the application of great effort.  There are no shortcuts and it cannot be faked, because the result is no less than personal transformation.  If that doesn't occur, you didn't try hard enough.  Those who can't commit to do their best at college are fooling themselves and would be better off not going. The predatory lending practices that ensnare unmotivated and unprepared students should be outlawed.",

				"commentBody": "For those of you wondering why the law school will still employ him, I assume it comes down to money. As president and chancellor, Starr\u2019s total annual compensation was in the $1 million range. Although he was removed from the presidency, he retained the chancellor position. That likely puts his compensation around $500,000.  When administrators return to the classroom, they often retain their salary. Now that Starr has stepped down as chancellor, I am sure his salary will remain deep into six figures, and well above that of his peers in the law school.  If Starr had remained chancellor, recruiting a new president would have been that much more complicated. Thus, Starr\u2019s return to the law school is the price Baylor is willing to pay to put his presidency behind it.",
