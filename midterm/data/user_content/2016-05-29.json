My grandfather, an immigrant from Jamaica, started his life in NYC as a real estate agent.  His ex-wife and two children  each owned their own homes in the Bronx.  <br/><br/>I remember when moving to Mt Vernon and New Rochelle was the ultimate goal of many Bronx residents.  Now younger people dream of buying their parents' home in the Bronx.  Where else in NYC can you get a three-bedroom house with a finished basement, driveway, garden with elevated patio for less than $250K? Everyone wants a piece of NYC right now.  The Bronx offers you the biggest chunk for the lowest price.  <br/><br/>Having witnessed 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy, I am wary of living downtown.  Here in the hills of the mainland, I feel safer.  Basements get flooded less, too. <br/><br/>The Bronx was always a great place to live for people who grow up here-- no matter what generation.    It's been one of the best kept secrets in NYC for a long time.  ",

Large parks  in every quadrant, walking paths shaded by oak trees, benches circling huge swaths of grass, the Oval fountain to rival any in Versailles, the cornucopia of tulips every spring including one so rich in color as to be almost black. Transportation to take you to every corner of New York- an express bus right outside your door, the number 6 Lexington line, numerous bus lines. Walking distance to every amenity- the US Post Office, the NY Public Library, its very own cinema, ( Thank you to the renovator.) St. Raymond's church with its lighted cr\u00e8che at Christmas, church bells sounding out the hour; diners where you can sit easily for an hour or more, friendly newspaper/candy stores where the owners know and greet you    warmly, its very own bagel bakery - I never left for work before I had a bagel just out of the oven, dripping in real butter from Zaro's; easy access to all the bridges, fifteen minutes to LaGuardia airport; the only borough connected by land to the rest of the USA, home to the black squirrel.
