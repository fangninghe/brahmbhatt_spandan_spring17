I don't know, and I imagine no one knows, whether the Taiwanese would have chosen independence in 1945.<br/><br/>But, even today a large number of Taiwanese think of Taiwan as part of China.  It's not as simple as an overwhelming number of Taiwanese desire to be independent, therefore it should be done.  <br/><br/>I have family who live in Taiwan and have lived there for generations before 1949.  They are Taiwanese and think of themselves as Taiwanese.  All of them would be very happy if Taiwan was an independent and sovereign country.  But, the fact is this view is not held by the the overwhelming majority.  And, even if it was, make no mistake, China will use force to prevent this.<br/><br/>Trump is using Taiwan as a pawn.  He has no loyalty to the people or to the ideals of democracy.  He is loyal only to money.  And he and his friends know there is a hell of a lot more money to be made in China than Taiwan.",

It is much too early to know if the new government under the leadership of the Trump White House and the Republican Congress will cause even greater uncertainty and subsequent instability but I suspect that the initial announcements at the State of the Union will NOT reduce the uncertainty in our economy or in the World economy.  <br/><br/>Energy prices can be very destabilizing and I think the US will fall further behind in the shift away from fossil fuels that the rest of the World will be leading in.  We only have 34 years until 2050 and a population of about 9 Billion, one can reasonably project that the World will not have enough energy to maintain the living standard that the World will expect.<br/><br/>Despite the promise of America becoming even greater than it is I believe that Nature will prevail.  Clearly, governments will need to make wise investments to improve the quality of living for the bottom half.  I think it is time for an Earth shot and much broader sharing of earnings and wealth.<br/><br/>I am uncertain about the outcome of the Electoral College vote.  This new allegation of complicity of the Trump campaign with Russia as reported in Eric Lipton's article is very disturbing.  Some of my friends are suggesting that President Obama convene a joint session of Congress to tell members what was found about the cyber manipulation of the election.",
