				"commentBody": "Nominee Trump is a demagogue--one to be classed with the likes of Louisiana's Gov. Huey Long.<br/><br/>It is ironic that the demagogic Trump has now turned on the demagogic party that spawned him--and that party leaders are waiting for further polls before deciding how to pay him back in kind.<br/><br/>Perhaps, however, it is time to turn away from our fixation on an individual demagogue and focus on the far graver threat: the institutionalized demagoguery of the GOP itself.<br/><br/>Demagoguery effectively shuts down rational discourse and reflective consideration of alternative solutions to our many problems.<br/><br/>Isn't that what the Grand Obstructionist Party is all about?<br/><br/>Among the GOP's demagogic strategies are appeals to divisive \"social/moral\" issues, identification with a shallow militaristic \"patriotism\" and a<br/>narrow Christian fundamentalism, obstructionist Hastert rules and Norquist pledges, etc.<br/><br/>While pursuing these strategies, many GOP politicians and spokespersons--not just candidate Donald Trump--employ the demagogue's favored techniques on a daily basis: gross oversimplification, fear mongering, scapegoating, emotional appeals, accusations that opponents are disloyal or weak, attacks on the news media, obstructive refusals of all compromise--and, yes, bald faced lies.<br/><br/>Donald Trump's candidacy is the symptom, not the disease.<br/><br/>The voters can readily reject this individual buffoonish demagogue.<br/><br/>But just who will reform this cadaverous Republican Party?",

Trump retains the support of his base but is losing soft supporters and independents while Hillary Clinton continues to gain among millennials, white females without college degrees and will likely have the largest margin among latino voters that we've ever seen. The gap between the Democratic and Republican nominees among white voters is the lowest it has been since Bill Clinton won re-election in 1996. It stands to reason that Hillary Clinton will have a margin of victory that aligns to the results in 2008 or 1996.",

Trump has not just shown himself to be a tad off kilter, he is a full blown basket case of a human being. Donald J Trump has clearly demonstrated that the needs of his ego supersedes those of all other causes. They rise above country, party and even family. If you think Mr. Trump cares one iota about you, your kids or your community, I assure you that he absolutely doesn't. Trump only cares about how much your applause sends a quick shot of energy though his decrepit and damaged psyche. You are not a person to him, only a drug. Republican nominee Donald J. Trump has revealed himself to be a very damaged man. You put him there republican voters, it is now up to you to end all of this madness and move on.",

Clear evidence of Trump's attitudes and behaviors over 30+ years are no substitute for gut feelings and hunches nurtured by HRC's fake smile, practiced (aka knowledgable) words, or unflattering pantsuits.",

We'd tried the celebrity thing: he had such confidence and charm, such simple answers to all our problems. Having gotten that out of our system, we brought back the boring, aging technocrat (now more crat than tech). He won the people's trust, and made them see that (due to our super-majority requirements for passing tax law) nothing could be accomplished until the obstructive Republicans were reduced to a super-minority. Once that was accomplished, he restrained the hotter heads among the victorious Democrats, turning them from politics and revenge to the boring business of governing. We've still got a long way to go, but we're headed in the right direction, something few other states can say. And just 6 years ago, we were deep in a hole and digging hard. It gets better.",
