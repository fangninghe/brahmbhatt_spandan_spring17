				"commentBody": "Interesting response. Perhaps her essay (which by the way if you pay attention to detail was for Berkeley and not for Stanford where she is going) it addresses something of who you are? I know Northville a little and quite a few people I know there have reacted pretty favorably to this essay as an accurate portrait of one side of this afflluent suburb. In particular, I would say the author seems to include herself in any criticism and the recklessness she feels to be how her school culture is. I guess as the NYT journalist says, she took some risk of the unthinking reaction of people such as yourself. And the essay in terms of writing style showed considerable talent and an eye for how the world is in all its moral complexity. ",

Although affluent, Northville is by no means \"the wealthiest\" city in Michigan.  As per my post, if she wanted to experience life outside of the suburban bubble she could easily have applied to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit instead of Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.  Hypocrite comes to mind...kind of like a New Yorker complaining about whining.  Hilarious as I have several very good friends in New York.

				"commentBody": "As is often the case, the comments are as entertaining as the essays themselves. Especially with regard to Northville High School, the responses  kept me laughing, frankly. As a rule, nothing demonstrates better how close the writer has come to being spot on in her observations than the frenzied defensiveness and heated denials made by her fellow students. Most interesting is how the commenters all really failed in a major way to get the point that the essay was about Ms. Meisner, the author, and not about them. And it does what a college essay is supposed to do - represent the student's point of view on the topic on which she chose to write and comment.  I think the responses - all heat but little light! - almost do more to prove her point than the essay itself! <br/><br/>Furthermore, to say that any of these students portrayed themselves as \"victims\" in these essays is grossly unfair to them and shows a real lack of understanding of what a college essay is about.  They should all be congratulated on their success - writing a good college essay is no easy thing and a source of major anxiety for many students. Doing a good job is something of which they can all be proud without snarky adults making stupid comments. ",

				"commentBody": "\"Competitions\" like this \"best essays\" contest really just exalt these essays into something they're not -- and not supposed to be!  <br/><br/>Essays are not free-standing writing competitions, but rather complementary parts (and a relatively small one!) of individuals' colleges applications.  An essay is meant to provide a chance for an individual applicant to highlight or explain some aspect of their own broader application 'package'.  In no shape or form, do essays 'compete' with each other in the way this contest suggests.  (Competition may be among applicants for slots in a given college, but that's between overall applications--grades, tests, recommendations, extracurriculars, etc..)<br/><br/>Fueling exacerbated hoopla about essays (outside the context of applications) is implicitly misinforming the public about the college admissions process, and what matters there (and how essays factor in).  <br/><br/>Worse still, this basically fuels the ever-expanding college-consultant rackets, especially those with a focus on essays (who play on applicants' / parents' anxieties about admissions to suggest that these essays play a role they just don't in order to essentially market the 'value' of their 'services')!  <br/><br/>This is a real disservice.   And one which has helped skew the admissions process at 'competitive' schools from the purposes of selecting applicants (colleges now spent time trying to access if applicants actually wrote their essays! and more fraught for applicants!",

				"commentBody": "And then, of course, there's Bernie Sanders who preaches much the same thing that The Donald's supporters like to imagine that their candidate does. The white working-class has, in fact, been royally screwed but Bernie tells us that the fault lies not with ethnic or racial minorities (who have ALSO been royally screwed) but rather with the \"royals\" themselves- the patricians, the CEOs, the Donald Trumps!!- who send jobs and companies abroad, hire undocumented aliens, bust unions and purchase Congressional representatives to ensure that they're treated with kids' gloves by the IRS and rack up the profits that the employees they decide to hold on to continue to earn on their behalf.  True enough: not all populists are bigots or xenophobes, and it may well prove necessary for Hillary and some of her supporters to acknowledge- as Bernie has- that the problems of the white working-class are worth devoting some serious time to.  The Donald can't win by appealing exclusively to white men, but Hillary won't win either without reaching out beyond her constituencies of blacks, Latinos and white career-women.  ",

				"commentBody": "I suppose good insightful writing is supposed to show us things we miss. So perhaps reflect that others may see what you don't or perhaps even that you are part of the problem. The author certainly writes as if she thought she was part of the problem, some of the emptiness she mentions. That is why I found her essay mature. She uses \"we\" a lot, rather than just suggest it's the  others. And having wanted to escape from a  largely different but also in some respect similiar high school culture, I think her personal testimony to how she feels as part of your school is probably as valid as your take. Maybe more so. I cannot say as I don't know your school.",

His heartfelt essay was about the lessons he had learned from a fellow student--someone not in his social circle--about friendship. I was easily drawn into a very touching story, but there were a couple of places that didn't seem to fit the tenor of the story. It appeared as if  there were two different writing styles. When I expressed my concern, my sister said her son's school counselor had made the \"corrections\" I found objectionable and thought detracted from the spirit of the essay. My advice to my nephew was to ignore his counselor's suggestions and to write the entire essay from his heart--just as he had for most of the story. I hope my nephew, who has since graduated from the college of his choice, learned a valuable lesson about trusting his own instincts.  ",
