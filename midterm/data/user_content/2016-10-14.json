				"commentBody": "I'm sorry but I have seen this exact same shift before.  When the Bill Cosby accusations became way too ignore.  When Anita Hill was testifying before Congress.  When Oprah Winfrey, Madonna, Maya Angelou, Pamela Anderson, Tori Amos, Fran Drescher, Fiona Apple, Mary J. Blige, Ashley Judd, and way, way too many other famous women shared their terrible stories of having been raped, sometimes as children, this shift always happened to some degree.<br/><br/>The stories are believable, and they never fail to fill me with unprintable rage.  But what always happens, it seems, most sickening of all, the assaults and rapes go right on.<br/><br/>I really wish that this time, maybe Trump is large and loud enough that our society can really pay attention and do something about this.  Sex education in third grade maybe, heavy on the notion of \"consent\".  Rape cases getting handled quickly, effectively, and resulting in extreme penalties for the rapists instead of the victims.<br/><br/>I oughta stop, as I'll get truly furious in a minute, but if Trump's notoriety finally causes America to do something major about sexual assault, I'd forgive him all the rest of this crud.  I fear next year we'll just hear more believable stories.",

As deplorable as trump is, I'm convinced the debacle he has created for himself is accelerating the cause of gender equality, even more than Hillary's candidacy alone. Both together can move mountains.<br/><br/>The same goes for the cause of racial equality and trump's birtherism. Shaking the rug for bugs helps you get at them.

Although the veil is clearly not the right solution, aren't we hypocritical to as women claim that these women have no grounds for their actions? We share a more similar reality than we dare admit. We like to believe that we are modern and that we live in a modern world, but for the sake of our modernity we keep quiet. We go on to denigrate them as backward, when in fact the issue is far more muddled for us and for them. Thank you for this lucid and refreshing article. I hope you are right and that all women will reach out to other women and with other women to speak out.",

It is true that they are caught in a economic cycle of decline, for which we all must feel sad.
