				"commentBody": "I respect Dr. Krugman immensely but think he is missing the plot on this. <br/><br/>Let's consider the facts: the Bank of England has the lowest nominal interest rates in their 322 year history. <br/><br/>The ECB is purchasing all sovereign debt float, BBB corporate paper, I can only assume cats and dogs next. <br/><br/>The BOJ is discussing \"helicopter money\" or combining fiscal and monetary policy to engineer inflation by ensuring demand comes with monetary expansion.<br/><br/>Every developed economy seems desperate to depreciate their currency in truest beggar-thy-neighbor fashion. <br/><br/>Since they cannot all depreciate their currencies against one another, they really just want to depreciate against the US dollar. Why is that? <br/><br/>Real USD rates (nominal less core PCE) are negative despite full employment and increasing core inflation as transitory deflationary factors fade.<br/><br/>QE has created bank reserves that are no longer excess after Basel III. Banks globally have no incentive to lend them. Banks are becoming less relevant.<br/><br/>Inflation is not dead. We are seeing extraordinary asset inflation with eye popping price to cash flow multiples.<br/><br/>Central banks were the heroes post-Crisis, but their increasing reliance on loose monetary policy to avoid dealing with structural issues will end up destroying their hard earned credibility.<br/><br/>Risks are most definitely not asymmetric with all due respect.",

				"commentBody": "I don't know who poses a greater danger to the general welfare lawyers or economists.<br/>In a world with endless supply and very little demand we are talking about inflation. I can't believe we are talking about Weimar Germany, Zimbabwe and Venezuela in a country where the is more than enough for all of us to eat, wear and fill up our rooms at the dump. Good housing sits empty from Maine to Baja California. Most of what we produce is electronic impulses and endless quantities of paper.<br/>History tells us of the Irish Starvation and how the economists warned about the danger to the Irish food export economy if we allowed food to be delivered to Ireland's starving peasants. Do schools of economics teach their students that every year of the starvation Ireland exported more than enough food to feed all of Ireland's hungry for the entire period of the blight and the economists insisted the health of the economy was more important than human life?<br/>Dr. Krugman is correct only about now being the time to explore 21st century technology ,now is the time to build 21st century infrastructure, now is the time to redesign and re-engineer our cities and now is the time to reinvent how we educate our children. These are things we should be doing not because of economics but because these are the things we should be doing.<br/>When economics dissuade us from doing what we should be doing it is time to stop listening to the soothsayers<br/>Economics is a very cloudy lense for looking into the future.",

Happiness is called a negative externality in our world, because happy, satisfied people are not conspicuous consumers. This is why most of our popular culture is driven by vanity, narcism, pride, lust, and so on. All of these empty things sell. <br/><br/>Robert Reich gave a short monologue in a documentary by Adam Curtis from 2002 called \"The Century of the Self\". It's in four parts, each one hour. I don't remember in which part Reich speaks. He explains to the viewer how capitalism exploits the irrationality of people, creating conspicuous consumers at large social cost. The Great Depression saw a return of rationality to America, but the post war boom put an end to that.<br/><br/> Today, both parties champion their respective versions of market solutions to all of our problems. Thomas Friedman is the patron saint of the Democratic Party. He also lives in complete darkness, along with his other neoliberal \"intellectuals\" who get paid handsomely to make ugly rich people seem benevolent.",

There is a lot of pent up demand. <br/><br/>In fact, this spending is just what we need and if Hillary can also make headway with student loan refinancing and incentives for homeownership. The increase in GDP, revenues, and inflation will give us some much better future debt to GDP projections from the CBO.<br/><br/>These more rosy budget projections will once again allow us to continue to have the political courage to make the changes we need for the future of our nation.<br/><br/>Well, that is how I see it.",

Whether people are lying about matters of fact or the validity of logical conclusions is itself a matter of fact.  But circumstantial evidence is enough to establish that fact even in the face of their denials only for people outside the mainstream.  For mainstream figures their denials must be reported on the same level as the matters of fact; otherwise, bias is present and objectivity is gone.<br/><br/>But for the Donald, the problem is much worse.  He claims to have seen a video of many Jersey City residents celebrating the World Trade Center's destruction, but no one else did and no one can find any such video.  The truth is that he is seeing things that do not exist, or making them up.    Objective reporting is to report what he claims to have seen and note that no one else saw it, rather than to report that he is seeing things or that a proven tendency of his to see things is manifesting itself again.<br/><br/>Objective reporting panders to those who make things up by reporting what they made up and that others disagree instead of reporting that they made something up and maybe describing what it was.  For the sake of \"balance\" and \"objectivity\" and to keep customers who side with those making things up, known liars and spinners and public relations people are treated with a deference that erases the distinction between an honest account and a smooth spiel.",

It showed people celebrating in the streets -- it was at least hundreds, if not thousands -- throwing candy, dancing and laughing. Only it was in Gaza and the West Bank. It was pretty devastating, right in the quake of such an awful tragedy.<br/><br/>Then he ALSO read at least one article about vastly smaller celebrations in New Jersey -- a handful of people, reported in the news. At least one of these articles was by Serge Kovaleski, the disabled reporter Trump was accused of mocking.<br/><br/>If you think about it, the two things dovetail very neatly. Only they are two separate things. Over time, with all the horror and pain of 9/11, they get blurred together.<br/><br/>It isn't fair to say nobody else saw it, or that nobody else conflated these two events (thousands of miles apart). I think honestly that a lot of people think that Muslims were very happy to see a major act of terrorism against the US, especially those engaged in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.<br/><br/>Hillary did a very similar thing with her tall tales about running from bullets on the tarmac in Bosnia. She conflated STORIES she was told on that trip -- warnings -- actual reports of real incidents -- and her own actual experience (being handed flowers by school children). Is it an out and out lie? Or just the blurring of experiences, that leads someone to mix up different inputs?",

The answer to that question is best answered with two questions:<br/><br/>1. has anyone questioned the authenticity of the DNC data dump?<br/><br/>The answer to that question is an obvious no. Would Debbie Wasserman Schultz have resigned if there was any possibility of claiming that the leaked emails were somehow altered or even falsified? Obviously, they were not.<br/><br/>But that hasn\u2019t stopped Wasserman Schultz from stating that she \u201ctook one for the team\u201d by resigning from the DNC<br/><br/>2. Would it even matter if it turned out that we have the DNC emails thanks to Russia?<br/><br/>In the final analysis, the answer has to be no, especially when one factors in the fact that the chair of an organization\u2019s duties include being aware of external dangers, as Wasserman Schultz demonstrated she is capable of when there was a question about the Sanders campaign having had access to Clinton campaign data.\"<br/><br/>See: <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2n0\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2n0\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2n0</a> <br/><br/>What the media focused us away from is the leaks themselves. How Assange does or doesn't curate his materials is beside the point. Any curation would have invalidated the data dump even more than the Russian angle has in the current public discussion. The DNC has a big problem. That should be the only focus.",

How about money laundering in favor of one candidate?  At the expense of other states and down ticket candidates. Do you think that that might affect an election?  How about the acknowledged favors and positions for crony donors? Still need more Deborah?  The DNC committed fraud and dishonesty against its own people.  Yet you have only spite and snark for those that might feel their vote was manipulated.  I sadly wont enjoy the schadenfreude that is surely coming.  Remember that cheating and stealing are how the Dems expect and except the game to be played.<br/>Bless your heart.",

How I wish the do-nothing Republicans in Congress had been pushed, relentlessly, by Krugman and all of his colleagues, shamed into action, rather than just sit out two congressional terms, allowing for millions of Americans to wither, not thrive.<br/><br/>We've known that we need to invest, stimulate, build, rebuild... We've known that Keynesian economics is our way out of the depression this Great Recession has been. We've not applied what we know. Will we now? The answer is only if that is what Clinton runs on specifically, rather than the lawyerly signalling she's been doing that no one believes. You can't pick Tim Kaine who is known to be a conservative when it comes to a lot of things and then claim to be a progressive. Kaine wants to relax Dodd Frank, was ok with paying less to social security recipients, and a host of other things that aren't progressive. <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2lP\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2lP\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2lP</a><br/><br/>Before we count our chickens, they must hatch. A Clinton win, you say? Maybe. How will such a win look in Congress? If Clinton is elected thanks to anti-Trump Republicans, will they hand her a Democratic Congress? Doubtful. If Clinton finally does the right thing and acknowledges the pain the lower middle and working classes are suffering and tries to rally them to her side, in earnest, will they vote for her and hand her, at least, a Democratic Senate? Without progressives, that calculus changes. See my new piece <a href=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2nG\" title=\"http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2nG\" target=\"_blank\">http://wp.me/p2KJ3H-2nG</a>",
