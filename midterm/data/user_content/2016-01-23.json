And we change when Sanders or Cruz come on. What is one supposed to do when the likely contenders for the Presidency are all unworthy of the Office? <br/><br/>Oh my. It all makes my head spin to think that one of these people on their way to the top of their respective pile will be our President. I feel extremely uneasy voting for any of them. Is this the best we can do as a nation? I think not. But so much must change if the dignity can return. And just to be clear, I do not favor the Tea Party or the group that has control over politics at the moment. Stating that a great deal must change doesn't mean I'd like to shut down the government or get rid of everyone and all the laws.<br/><br/>But I haven\u2019t had the urge to vote since about 1976. Looking at the news, I am not likely to do so in the near future either. Thank you for your time in reading this.",
