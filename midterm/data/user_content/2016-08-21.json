				"commentBody": "That's incredibly authoritarian on the part of Germany.  <br/><br/>Why should anyone be *forced* to reveal their, or their child's, gender?  To me, that's like a law forcing people to reveal their or their child's race, skin color, or ethnicity.  Or sexual orientation!  Especially when so many people today are finally questioning the social construct of gender, and transsexual rights have finally made it onto the media radar, how can one's gender be anyone's business aside from one's sexual partner(s) (if any) and one's doctor (if one has a disease related to one's sex organs, sex chromosomes, or sex hormones).<br/><br/>Astounding that today's German people, who generally seem at such pains to avoid repeating the fascism of their country's recent past, haven't protested such a law, or even allowed it to be passed in the first place.",

Terrible time in the NW, had to ultimately get help from the blog with AZALEATREE (which I kind of had in the back of my mind somehow with the L, but can't explain it).  My downfall was sticking with BLEU instead of thinking AZUR.  When the tree bloomed out, my blueing (downer blues?) problem became obvious, and the rest filled in quickly.<br/><br/>I never worry about what I've heard of before, just what could make sense and fills the squares in a reasonable and often satisfying way (just \"clicks\").  These late-weeks are always difficult for me with the variable clue pitching speeds.  (Someone should write a research paper on cognition from all the blog responses from everyone.)<br/><br/>(RERUNS finally as the satisfying answer to those recent clues, and Star Trek's Mr Atoz makes a cameo!)",

				"commentBody": "Krugman talks about the gridlock we never cared about.  Wrong gridlock!<br/><br/>Keynes did make reference to ides such that infrastructure spending was necessary in the long run and it that it made economic sense to treat these as investments on par with other capitalistic investments.  That is, we should think of these investments on par with business investments that produce gains.  He was just wrong if that is what he was talking about.<br/><br/>But what about the other claim, that this recession is just artificial and that we can move up the GDP with a deliberate attempt?  We can move it up while it exists, but is it like sugar like Geithner believed?  It depends upon context.<br/><br/>Basing a science upon such horrible evidence as economics has is an affront to real science.  Given global economics, I think almost every economist in existence is pretty ignorant including Krugman.<br/><br/>Why didn't this field ever try to do better?  Perhaps college is the problem.  Perhaps we need new non-profit entities that attempt to foster new thought in young people (12-20) in both social 'sciences', engineering and science.<br/><br/>If I make some money, it will be directed towards this.  Almost everyone trying today is doing the wrong things, fostering the wrong instincts in us.<br/><br/>Competition is fine, but competition between cooperative organizations is something we don't know how to cater.  We have not even begun to build reasonable societies.  We have not even begun to understand human circumstances.",

It is basic public health.<br/><br/>However, it is not \"a threat to our ability to have healthy children\" for an entire generation.

I hope she does a good job.  But, if she doesn't, she certainly can't muck it up any more than many of the men have.<br/>As for your remark \"she will do more of what she has always done, always without exception.\"  Most of the time when \"always\" or \"never\" are used in a statement, it isn't a credible statement.<br/>One of my major concerns is about Supreme Court judges and I do trust Hillary to make good choices in this area.
