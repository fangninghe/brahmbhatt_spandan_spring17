In fact, if he didn't need the party's structure to be a viable candidate he wouldn't have joined up in the first place.  When Bernie fails to win the nomination, he'll only stick around if he thinks he can get changes to the party platform.  If that doesn't happen to his liking he'll drop the party in a New York minute.",

Do you really think we should have despoiled the environment for hundreds of miles (against the wishes of farmers, etc.) and enabled the risk of huge costly spills, while promoting the addition of more carbon/pollution to our atmosphere, for 35 jobs?<br/><br/>Of course environmentalists want jobs.  But the Keystone project would not have delivered them.",

				"commentBody": "The jobs of the future are not the same as the jobs of the past.  The changes began with the inevitable development of technology plus the creation and expansion of the internet.  These two factors, coupled with individuals and enterprises using these tools and infrastructure to connect to global markets, weakened the unionized labor force.  These occurrences were NOT caused by  any particular political party, but rather by the inherent effect of \"connectivity\" between markets and individuals.  Having said this, from a Labor force perspective, there IS a significant difference between the Democrats and the Republicans.  Which party has continually supported 1) improved working conditions, 2) Equal Pay for Equal Work, 3) Maternity Leave, 4) ant-Discrimination Laws, and 5) an increase in the Minimum Wage?  The Democrats!  The Republicans, as a whole, have NEVER supported these efforts.    ",

				"commentBody": "Vietnam is still a relatively poor country, and can't really afford to buy expensive U.S.-made weapons.  Thus, the lifting the arms embargo would be an important albeit mostly a symbolic gesture.  After this, the U.S. and other more wealthy nations, such as Japan and South Korea who are also threatened by China, should take steps to support Vietnam (including providing direct military assistance) so that Vietnam has the means to become a stronger foot soldier as part of a larger efforts to contain China's rise.<br/>Regarding the basis of improved U.S-VN relations or the the lifting of the arms embargo, if the standard is based solely on Vietnam's record on human rights, it will be very easy for the pro-China elements in the Vietnamese Government (regrettably there are some) to sabotage the process simply by arresting a few dissidents or protestors in a very public manner on the eve of President Obama's trip.  It would not be surprising if over the next few days, the pro-China elements in Vietnam suddenly become more aggressive in ordering arrests of political dissidents or protestors in order to interfere with the improving U.S.-VN ties.   If they do occur, President Obama should simply ignore them and proceed with his trip to Vietnam as planned.  ",

				"commentBody": "I have no idea if Rafael Cruz had any affiliation with the various anti-Castro Cuban groups funded by the CIA in the early 1960's but for anyone to even reference the Warren Commission as some kind of authority on President Kennedy's assassination is laughable.  Members of the Warren Commission such as former prosecutor and Senator Richard Russell privately dissented from the \"magic bullet\" theory.  Warren Commission member Hale Boggs stated FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover lied his eyes out to the Warren Commission.  Anyone who is familiar with the Church Committee investigations of the 1970's into the Kennedy and King assassinations know that the Warren Commission explanation was solely a political solution and cover-up that LBJ, J. Edgar Hoover and Allen Dulles believed was necessary for 'national security' reasons. ",

Now we are proposing to protect them from China and they want to be more independent of Russia.<br/><br/>50,000 of our soldiers, including my best friend, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese died in that disaster caused by neocons including Dulles, McNamara, Westmoreland, LBJ, Bush Sr. sold the phony \"domino theory\" to justify the war, and other war criminals, Nixon &amp; Kissinger expanded the war into Cambodia with their disastrous, phony plan to end the war.<br/>Now we are going to rescue the Vietnamese from the Chinese and enhance our control in Southeast Asia.
