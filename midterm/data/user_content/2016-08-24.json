				"commentBody": "\"In Germany, employees' premiums are a percentage of their incomes, so low-wage workers simply pay rock-bottom insurance rates.<br/><br/>The sickness funds are Germany's version of a \u201cpublic\u201d health insurance system, and it covers nearly everyone. But a small segment (13 percent) of the population, generally the very wealthy, can opt-out and instead go with the private Krankenversicherung, which follows rules more similar the pre-Obamacare U.S. individual insurance market. ... All things considered, it\u2019s good to be a sick German. There are no network limitations, so people can see any doctor they want. There are no deductibles, so Germans have no fear of spending hundreds before their insurance ever kicks in.\"<br/><br/>\"Prices for procedures there are lower and more uniform because doctors\u2019 associations negotiate their fees directly with all of the sickness funds in each state. That's part of the reason why an appendectomy costs $3,093 in Germany, but $13,000 in the U.S.<br/><br/>\u201cIn Germany, there is a uniform fee schedule for all physicians that work under the social code,\u201d Schlette said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge catalogue where they determine meticulously how much is billed for each procedure. That\u2019s like the Bible.\u201d<br/>...<br/>Maryland, for example, has been regulating how much all of the state\u2019s hospitals can charge since 1977. A 2009 study published in Health Affairs found that we would have saved $2 trillion ... (at the same growth rate).\"",

				"commentBody": "America has never been above violating the rights of others. This nation's economic foundations were built upon the blood and sweat of black slaves. In the 20th century, we imprisoned thousands of Japanese citizens. The opening decade of the, once gloriously anticipated, 21st century was marked by the slaughter of 300,000 Iraqi and Afghani citizens because \"someone\" had to pay for the intellence lapse that allowed 9/11 to happen. Our great and powerful Intelligence gathering agency, made to look so foolish after 9/11 and the Iraq war, was turned on American citizens. Our head of intellegence, James Clapper, lied to congress and yet manages to hold that post. Now we see an innocent man, who has lost 14 years of his life for nothing, given a brief hearing before he is returned to America's gulag. And yet America continues to label itself as \"exceptional.\" <br/><br/>The only thing that is truly exceptional about America, is the sheer level of hypocrisy with which we hold our noses in the air as we criticize the barbarism of the nation's we vanquish, the millions we imprison during our self-riteous \"War on Drugs,\" and the international conventions we violate with things like indefinite imprisonment without charge.",

				"commentBody": "\"In any event, it is clear Bush &amp; Co. tried to find a middle ground with waterboarding--something more than what would be considered lawful to inflict on a U.S. citizen or within the territory of the U.S. but something much more defensible than what our enemies in this war regularly engage in (burning alive, live decapitation, etc.). \"<br/>No, wrong. The Constitution plainly describes treaties ratified with the advice and consent of 2/3 of the Senate as \"the supreme law of the land.\" That roster of treaties includes the Geneva Conventions and the International Convention Against Torture, making waterboarding (which we successfully prosecuted as a capital war crime) completely out of bounds. And neither the provisions of those treaties, nor the bill of rights' requirements of due process, speedy trial and freedom from cruel and unusual punshment specify in any way that those protections apply only to US citizens or on US soil. In fact, the bill of rights provisions only say what the government may not do, with no caveats whatsoever. You parrot failing rationalizations used by the Junior Bush Reign of Error. And how many wrongs make a right, in comparison to the enemy. Why the military was against what the CIA overenthusiastically  embraced is because what we do to others could easily be visited upon captured soldiers. Sir, we HANGED Japanese officers who ordered the waterboarding of our soldiers in WWII. It is sheer hypocrisy to try to justify its use.",

They even threw around the term \"treason\" because they viewed the second group not as siding with principle and the rule of law, but with the enemy instead.<br/><br/>It used to be a high point of pride among Americans that we did not torture.  Even when we faced TRUE existential threats during WWII and the Cold War, we did not abandon this principle.  It gave us power through moral standing, and among other things yielded us many talented immigrants who viewed our society as humane.<br/><br/>As traumatic as 9/11 was, the threat was never existential.  Al Qaeda was the enemy, not Germany, Japan, and Italy combined.  Relative to those countries, the threat from Al Qaeda was infinitesimal.<br/><br/>This story made me sick.  It made me sick because of the unspeakable agony delivered to Mr. Zubaydah and others in our names.  But it also made me sick because of the ease at which most Americans were happy to abandon the \"no torture\" principle in the face of a relatively small threat.<br/><br/>I really wonder what the term \"American Exceptionalism\" means any more when so many Americans are willing to so easily abandon bedrock principles because of their own cowardice.",

You could indeed ride in the connector area and there were ceramic-like handles for you to hold onto during the bumps and curves.  Extending the idea to entire trains just makes sense.  It allows for more people in the same train.  It also allows for movement away from threats, something that cannot happen when you have the end doors of the cars locked.",
