Heck. blame Nixon for wage stagnation because he opened the door to relations with the PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC of China. What about Eisenhower. The interstate highway system opened the door for globalization, unleashing unfettered capitalism and destroying local businesses. It's easy.",

I think the American people want the next president to be interesting, all the time. The Donald is always interesting and perhaps he will be remembered as the candidate who made politics interesting, again.<br/><br/>As a Clinton supporter, I am hoping that she find some Chutzpah, before it is too later. I suggest that she push the idea of a woman president to the max. I believe this is her trump card. People will say, it's not fair asking people to vote for you because you are a woman. So, I am afraid  that Hillary will not rise to the occasion in her campaign.<br/><br/>Thank you Donald for waking the country up!<br/>==================================",

Trump can slam them by upping the entry fee to something ''that will REALLY mean something to the VETS!'' - Like $15M.  This way, if they say ''no'' they are cheap shots.  If they say ''yes'' Trump has a win/win - without cracking open his wallet he's given $15M to the Vets.  Then, he sets the rules for the debate.  If Cruz's side starts to whine, Trump throws down the gauntlet and accuses them of backing out and ''Stabbing the Vets in the back, just like Cruz would if elected, unless he speaks out against this outrage by HIS PEOPLE.''  - Really, they think they're in control and they just stepped into Donald's parlor.  Ailes is in a power struggle for his job with the younger Murdoch generation, and he is on the verge of being retired.  That's the real story here.",
