It's very in-clubby and off-putting.  I like good, complex puzzles, but I just find most of the recent ones irritating and not pleasurable.  How about having someone else take over and sending this self-congratulatory cadre off to entertain themselves.  They certainly aren't entertaining me.",

Both politically relevant to our current time. The parallels are frightening and disturbing. History is repeating itself with slight twists. It helps to be informed and prepared for the worst of it. <br/><br/>A newer book I found profoundly moving was Voices from Chernobyl by Svetlana Alexeivitch.

I don't know if it's the water in New York, or the proximity of the center of finance to all that flows through politics here, but what you are in effect saying is, this approach to fix public infrastructure with private money cannot possibly work. The amount of money sloshing in and around government renders the viability of honest service a pipe dream, working its failures into theft of school funds, three card monte public contracts, peek a boo backroom lawmaking, and all manner of disservice to the taxpaying innocents. This is just another wrinkle for an increasingly desperate public hoping for a cure from a pie in the sky alliance between government agents looking to sell public assets, and finance privateers looking for good investments in the \"public sector\".",

				"commentBody": "Even the most correct explanation of the election results is not immediately consequential.  What is urgent is a need to stop Trump now. His anti-commonwealth actions and governing choices show that he poises US political landscape to change abruptly and in the most anti-democratic way once he is in WH. Sadly, regardless of the political &amp; economic consequences of the incoming changes he will be supported by enough populus in 4 years - many of his supporters will be fueled only by the racial hatred while many more will be gladly complacent or believe his lies about economy. Trump's lies are accepted as reality by his base that will not get educated overnight. Instead, he will continue feeding them with increasingly sophisticated fantasies that will cater to their worst instincts and hidden hopes. Indeed, \"the worse the better\" is a safe bet for Trump. A tradition of a Democratic Republic that we assume immutable, will be dismantled and made unrecoverable during his 1st year \u2013 much aided by the fuel lobby-controlled GOP &amp; GOP-controlled judicial branch. Having lived in kleptocratic autocracy for the most of my life, this is what I see Trump brings to America.  This country will then have to go through the major cataclysm - such as a nuclear war - to reset the stage for any possibility of a Democracy.  I am not even mentioning environmental catastrophe that Trump\u2019ll make \"more likely than not.\"<br/>Something needs to be done urgently, in the next 3 weeks, to stop the inevitable.",
