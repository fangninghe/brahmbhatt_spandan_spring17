The other is Ted Cruz working very hard to overcome a basic aura of a less likeable and smarter version o the character Jon Lovitz played on SNL skits in the 80's I think.  \"Yeah.. that's the ticket\".  An Elmer Gantry who does become a smart lawyer and an amateur evangelist.  I lived in Dade County, Florida when the refugees from Castro's Cuba began their flight.  I later got to know other Cuban immigrants including a young woman who came to the U.S. after first leaving for Spain in the early seventies and beginning her college education here.  her father a physician by training an a dissident was in Cuba in prison.  My take on those refugees is that the U.S. the ones I have known personally make little issue of their status and don't use it for any purpose other than to remember it and their homeland.  The politically minded have been ill served with this 60 year period of limbo anti-Castro have put so many in.  Cruz and Rubio are nothing like my college Spanish language instructor who was a lawyer in Cuba and retrain to teach Spanish and Spanish Culture.  He was a kind inspiring man who imparted to a rural Appalachian 24 year old a love for the language and the culture as well as the people.  He didn't make a dent in my attitude toward opportunistic politicians. ",

Clinton, alas, is the candidate of the Democratic party establishment, which means that that establishment too stands firmly for letting inequality continue to increase, as do those in the academy and media like Paul Krugman who support Clinton over Sanders. Indeed, on the question of increasing inequality, the Clintonite Democratic Party is one with the Republican Part of W and Romney, differing only on the rate of increase. And is wasn't just a nightmare: we really did see Obama ready to give away the New Deal store if only the Republicans would sign on to a slight tax increase -- and then a tax increase so as to shrink the deficient, not to reduce inequality. How can any admirer of FDR Atlee and Scandinavia call him- or herself a Democrat today? How can one even vote for such a party? I will not be voting for Clinton; I will either not vote at all or vote for Trump who at least is against NAFTA and TPP type trade treaties, for reducing tensions with Russia, and for not getting into so many wars.",

College degrees have become a requirement for jobs that realistically could be done without one. At this point, a college degree (or several) is a young person's best bet to avoid a life of crippling poverty. We have largely dismantled vocational programs here in America, we do not have strong apprenticeship programs (see Germany) and do not pay living wages for a large portion of the jobs that are available without college degrees. We need to strengthen the options for those that do not go to college, invest more in education at the K-12 level and provide living wages and a bigger social safety net.<br/><br/>We as a country have also decided to inflict millions with the yoke of debt for simply trying to better their lives and gain educations. Financial considerations are a large reason as to why students drop out. The college as a business model needs to be rethought because a more educated society is of value to all of us. ",

Let's not even forget that some of our most famous business leaders are college dropouts, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, founders of Twitter...to name but a few. Famous investor Kirk Kekorian dropped out of school after 8th grade. The founders of Chick-Fil-A, Continental Oil and Petron Tequila never went to college, and these are just the famous billionaires.

He has already attempted to back away from some of those promises, explaining that he doesn't have a clear timetable for their fulfillment, since that will be achieved only with the cooperation of Congress.
