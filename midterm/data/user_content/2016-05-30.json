				"commentBody": "This was a big comeback episode - meaning we caught up on some missing characters. Uncle Benjen - back. Dragon - back. Walder Frey - back again. Oleanna -back. We did not see Sansa or Littlefinger, but we know they are plotting with Jon Snow from last week. Nor Theon and Yara. Nice to see Sam's family - what is it with these family compounds, all courtyard happiness and dinner table angst, just like the Starks used to be. And how did little Sam go from being an infant to a large toddler in a short time? They grow up too fast - except in this case, it really was too fast, a few months has resulted in 2 years of growth in this little kid. Hmm.....  The whole House of Black and White is getting really tiresome, unless it's all been about turning Arya into a merciless assassin, which was always her goal anyway. And the Sparrow thing is looking more and more like a red herring - we don't believe for a minute that Margery has become a \"convert\" - looks like her pretense at being a Sparrow acolyte is just another of her plots to gain an upper hand on Cersei - the Lannisters have lost because the Tyrells, led by Margery and Oleanna, have won, scheming to use the Sparrows zeal to take \"guiding\" Tommen on the Iron Throne out of Cersei's iron grip- at least until Dany and Jon turn up, of course. Yes, it is nice to see Jaime out and about again - except that his odysseys never end well. But the greatest comeback character from the books has yet to turn up - where's Lady Stoneheart???",

None sees a problem with what Xi is doing or at least is brave enough to say so if they do. With no exceptions they loved the big military parade held last year and said it made them enormously proud to be Chinese. A few do complain of how censored their news is but it's VERY few. Since most of them are not well-versed in the history of the Cultural Revolution they don't understand why all of this mindless deifying of Xi concerns me so much. I point out that while Obama is reasonably popular here there aren't enormous portraits of him everywhere and he is openly criticized, often very harshly. I ask them, \"When was the last time you saw anything on TV that was even mildly critical of Xi?\" No one can think of even a single occasion. ",

				"commentBody": "There are many many things that can go wrong with this. Even with collision avoidance you just made a HUGE traffic block if it has to stop for something for any length of time. Plus the turning factor of waiting for it. Wrecks will cause crazy long backups. How big of a tow truck will that need? If they have to fix it on the spot it may be days depending on whats damaged. <br/><br/>Monorails were invented years and years ago because smart people then knew something like this was bad idea and trashed it. <br/><br/>Put the people transport above with small supports going down (not much land needed) and the only way a collision can happen is if a fool or criminal gets on the elevated tracks. (Yes that has happened)<br/><br/>This should have never left the paper it was drawn up on. <br/><br/>Yes I am an engineer and I figure out and fix dumb engineers ideas for a living. <br/><br/>This is a cool movie prop.

Curitiba, Brazil has a solution that works pretty well: dedicated bus lanes down the center of major roads, with above ground stations where people pay at a turnstile and then board the multi-segmented buses, which have doors that open like subway doors on a raised platform.  Yes, you need to pay for and make room for the center lanes, but it is also much cheaper than building subway lines.  But I wonder if even monorails might be more tried and true than what is proposed in this article.",

				"commentBody": "Communist Party leaders in Beijing revile Ms. Tsai for many reasons. First of all, she and her party, the Democratic Progressive Party, pose a threat because, unlike in China, they were chosen through a competitive election process and secured solid popular mandates. When was the last time voters in China were given the opportunity to chose their leaders, whether at the provincial level or nationally?<br/><br/>The DPP and Ms. Tsai have been very careful not to provoke China by proposing an accelerated drive towards independence--they know well that Chinese leaders would move to stop them using every means at their disposal. Even so, perhaps the biggest worry for the Communist Party is that Tsai and her supporters will not remove from their party's charter references to securing independence for Taiwan (they believe that those who vote for the DPP would never accept this--and they are likely right). <br/><br/>Finally, and this is likely an intangible for some, but Ms. Tsai is simply more attractive than the realpolitik apparatchiks who run the Communist Party. She may not be charismatic, but she is someone that Chinese voters in Taiwan trust because she has established a reputation for probity and consensus-based policy making that differs from the corruption and cronyism that marred the reputations of Taiwan's first DPP president, Chen Shuibian and others of his generation (and certainly is a problem for Xi Jinping and his cohorts).
