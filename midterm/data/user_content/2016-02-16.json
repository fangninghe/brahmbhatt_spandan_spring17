				"commentBody": "These are the end of times for the Republican party as we knew it. Trump and Cruz each represent \"unelectable\" factions of the party, that cumulatively are the majority of Republicans, but can never be reconciled.  The party has three major factions now; and only inchoate anger unites them.  <br/><br/>Having the partly leadership openly and blatantly refusing to consider Obama's appointment would be the mark of political idiocy in any ordinary time -- instead the party leaders would mumble meaningless pieties, slow-walk everything, reject a candidate ... and Obama's time would run out.  No crisis or posturing or immediate damage to centrist Republicans.  <br/><br/>Instead the party is provoking a crisis solely because most Republicans are too scared of their own voters, who are demanding the unlikely or even impossible, to do the rational thing.<br/><br/>With Trump and Cruz the leading Republicans the chances of a Republican president are vanishing as the days go by.  No sane political observer expects either of them to be able to win, even against Sanders.<br/><br/>Logically seeing the disaster that is the presidential campaign, the Republicans would do everything they can to attempt to hold onto the senate and maintain a large majority in the house.  <br/><br/>But Scalia's death has provoked them into a foolish tantrum.   And it looks like another one may be not too far away: Paul Ryan getting \"Boehnered.\" <br/><br/>The Republicans are dissolving into a circular firing squad. ",

I asked her what her career goal was. and she replied, \"certified registered nurse anesthetist.\" Such a well-defined goal at such a young age is unprecedented in my experience, but it made perfect sense. Interested in medicine, she had followed doctors around in the hospital and their offices, and every one had advised her not to go to medical school. She grew up on a ranch and is unusually mature with a highly developed sense of responsibility. She will graduate with a nursing degree, spend a year or two as a clinical nurse, earning at least as much as a resident after four years of medical school, then go on to nurse anesthesia school for another two years. She will earn nearly as much as an MD anesthesiologist, not have a huge debt, and  have less malpractice risk because she will not be doing the risky cases. Most of all, she will have a life outside of medicine.<br/>Daniel Allan, MD, FACS",

This article makes a small mention of an option that might be considered more often to the benefit of babies and their moms.  You can nurse your baby when you are with the baby, and when someone else must do the feeding that person can use formula.  This eliminates the need for pumping for those who don't have the time or space to do it.  Back in the '80's, when my kids were born, the available breast pumps were pathetic, there was no place at work to pump, and help was nonexistant.  So when I went back to work after three months I weaned them during the daytime and nursed them in the afternoon, evening, and morning.  putting this out there as an option might keep families breast feeding longer than many now do, still getting its benefit at half of their feedings.  I literally never hear this mentioned.",

If you fail to take into account that the majority of mothers combo feed to some extent, and instead push unrealistic goals like \"exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months,\" then you may very well end up with less breastfeeding altogether.  For many women, it's literally impossible to pump enough when they go back to work, so supplementation is a given.  For other women (many more than people think), they just never make enough milk for the baby to thrive.  Milk production is far from perfect, and forget about it once the mother returns to work.  <br/><br/>Also, supplementing with formula in the first week for babies that have lost weight has been shown to actually increase breastfeeding rates overall.

But I disagree and I give him in response the words of the American author William Faulkner when writing about the belief that we have time.  A father giving his son a watch said \"I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire; it\u2019s rather excruciatingly apt that you will use it to gain the reducto absurdum of all human experience...The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.\"  Two hundred millennia we've spent on this pale blue dot and we've only become better at our self-eradication.  A good philosopher should by now know that \"out of the crooked timber of humanity nothing straight was ever made.\" It's not hopelessness I'm arguing for but a cruel truth about knowing the future and the core principle of induction in science:  Sustained past performance is indeed an indication of future outcomes. And the record of the past in sum (200K years) is not good.  Just because we\u2019ve played with the scientific method in the last 500 years doesn\u2019t assure me that we won\u2019t regress to what we were in the first 199,500 years of our existence. Progress is not what we\u2019ve been good at since we evolved to homo sapiens. In a long horse race even an old nag has a short burst in speed, before she returns to a feeble trot and keels over with no finish in sight. Ergo, I wouldn't bet so hopefully on our number.",
