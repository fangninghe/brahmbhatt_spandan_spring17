				"commentBody": "Israel has agreed to give up land for peace many times. Gaza is an example of what happens when Israel trusts an enemy whose stated goal is to obliterate Israel. Gaza has been used as a terrorist base to lob rockets at Israeli civilians on a daily basis. Hamas has built tunnels to be able to attack Israelis on their own territory. Yasser Arafat was offered 95% of what he asked for but still turned it down. There is no dealing with an enemy whose goal is to make Israel disappear. Let the so-called Palestinians, who are the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those who left Israel because the other Arab nations told them they would be able to go back in a few days. That was 60 years ago. Palestinians are the only group in the world who are refugees for this long. Let them give some concessions. Start by recognizing that Israel is there permanently and they need to make peace. ",

				"commentBody": "Interesting piece of historical revisionism; and with a predictable agenda, to boot.<br/><br/>Yeltsin didn\u2019t precipitate the disintegration of the USSR: he merely exploited an inevitability caused by a governance system that had failed for 73 years to materially improve the lives of the people it governed. Gorbachev personified that failed model; and, indeed, continued to defend it while out of office. Ronald Reagan\u2019s concerted effort to bankrupt the USSR with an arms race they couldn\u2019t afford certainly didn\u2019t hurt. <br/><br/>The impression conveyed by this op-ed is that Gorbachev honorably acceded to provide a better future for his people and that of other peoples the Soviets had bound to them by force for decades. Nonsense. He surrendered in a war already lost, his empire broke and in crumbling ruins. If it remained marginally viable, he wouldn\u2019t have surrendered.<br/><br/>That he saw to the responsible passing of nuclear weapons authority to Russia in a controlled manner was commendable but no more than one would have expected: if he hadn\u2019t, the highly-scripted exchange between these two world leaders likely would have been quite different.<br/><br/>And now the agenda. Two presidents, world leaders both overflowing with competence and gravitas \u2026 compared to Donald J. Trump and Vladimir Putin. You could at least TRY not be so offensive while so laughably transparent.<br/><br/>Bush 41 managed his world well. Trump faces a fundamentally different world, and will use different means of managing it successfully.",

							"commentBody": "I reread this piece  searching for evidence about why Gorbachev resigned and could find none. I fail to see what is revisionist about what was printed. There are a mere 5 paragraphs in which the authors provide skeletal background for the text of the scripted verbatim conversation between these two leaders. I fail to see where it is revisionist, offensive or laughably transparent. <br/><br/>It will be 25 years since this conversation took place. The events leading to this conversation caused  significant changes both then and for the future. Just as the 2016 US presidential election will significantly change the world in ways yet to unfold. Aside from the anniversary of this phone call, it is relevant because it contrasts the differences between the current leader of Russia and the soon to be leader of the US. <br/><br/>To point out those differences is not offensive. Unless of course you voted for Trump. The only thing potentially laughable here is Trump's transparency and the con he sold US voters. Unfortunately, those folks can't see that they've been duped! What you see is what you get. He lies despite video tape documentation, he is appointing more wealthy people to his cabinet than Carter's has liver pills. He encourages violence he  bullies, he demeans women, minorities, the disabled. Worst of all he's legitimized extreme racism. This Alt Right stuff... you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. Come to think of it, so is Donald Trump. ",

I've disagreed with some of his individual decisions but you're dreaming if you really believe that he or The Donald or any other U.S. chief executive has the power or the authority to prevent Sunnis and Shiites and Israelis from killing one another or Russia from invading Crimea (not that Mr. Trump has anything much to say about the latter event in any case). Much of the world is in turmoil right now but the U.S. (even including New Jersey) remains a pretty safe place in which to live.  For that you can thank our incumbent President and his sensible homeland security policies.  If his successor means to \"shake things up\" it's far more likely that the end result will be less safety and security for the U.S. and no reduction at all in the upheaval being experienced outside of our borders. (And, btw, who is it again who's been threatening to curtail payment on Europe's defense?)         ",

				"commentBody": "I'm not on the same political side as George Bush Senior, but he and Gorbachev were both good men.  I wish the same could be said of Putin and trump; whatever accommodation these kindred spirits reach only bodes ill for the future<br/><br/>It's worth speculating how different subsequent history might have turned out if the west had not almost casually allowed NATO to expand to Russia's border, despite assurances to the contrary.  I doubt if the United States would take kindly to a Russian military presence in this hemisphere, as the Cuba Missile Crisis proved.  NATO expansion was one of two factors that almost guaranteed the rise to power of Putin or someone like him.  The other factor was Russia's cold-turkey embrace of raw capitalism, largely on the advice of Chicago-school economists who descended on Russia en masse, seeing it as a lab for their ideology.  Ordinary Russians went through an extended period of privation which soured them on democracy and steered them towards electing an autocrat.   The rest is history. <br/><br/>Putin is the same character as a capitalist oligarch/autocrat that he was as communist KGB chief.  He pines for the old Soviet sphere of influence and wants to \"make Russia great again\".  He wants NATO gone.  So naturally he makes nice to NATO-skeptic trump.<br/><br/>Whether its expansion was a good idea or not, it's now a necessary reality for helping defend Russia's neighbors.  You can't blame them for being nervous.  We live in dangerous times.",

							"commentBody": "I agree with mancuroc's statement re the West \"casually\" allowing expansion of NATO to Russia's border having played a significant role in today's increasingly tense and contentious situation. Our naivete about projecting presumably legitimate values, of promoting democracy in the unstable, rapidly changing political circumstances in the former USSR's sphere of influence, was deeply ahistorical. A complex set of social, political and economic forces were unleashed with the unraveling of the USSR and Gorbachev's resignation. However, I think that what was under-appreciated in the West was Russia's underlying need to maintain a  buffer zone securing it from any future German invasion. The US legitimately takes its share of credit for its heroic role in WW II, but Putin has tapped into Russia's awareness that it lost 10,000,000 in military deaths and another 16,000,000 in civilian deaths during the war. Compare that to US losses of 407,000 and 12,000, respectively, a completely different order of magnitude, and you get a sense of how our values of promoting democracy might be seen as an existential threat.

He is open and does so many unexpected and contradictory things that whatever he is up to remains obscured.  <br/><br/>If she had been running against Romney, this explanation might make sense.  But she was running against Trump.  She did much better than Jeb!, Marco, or Ted, but not quite well enough.  Her problem was not so much her bad points as what Donald was able to make of them.  ",

It really doesn't matter what his motive is: whether his tough talk is simply an \"an opening bid\" , or a pointed reminder to Russia that the guard has changed in Washington.<br/><br/>But the fact that he feels compelled to respond instantly to an address from Russia or any other hotspot, is alarming. He has a knee-jerk need to jump into the fray long before he and his aides have  considered all their options.<br/><br/>Let's face it: Trump is a hothead.  NSA advisor Michael Flynn is a hothead. Bannon is a hothead, although he has more patience the Donald.<br/><br/>Elsewhere in reporting on this issues, it was said that \"Trump flicked away the efforts of aides to get him to calm down.\"<br/><br/>If Donald Trump refuses to listen to the very people with the power to challenge Trump's lousy self-control, we're in far worse trouble than even I thought a month ago.",

We can clearly see the picture now.  Yes, he sorrounds himself with those you mention.  We see his tweets like a silly dangerous child.  We read about and acknowledge those who he has chosen to lead his cabinet and his days in our country's Oval Office, which we citizens turn over to him.<br/><br/>We are in disbelief, disgust, heart ache - not necessarily even for us, but in my case, for my kids, my grandchildren, and everybody else's families, too!<br/>Well, let us, in the midst of it, do something special to celebrate the holiday weekend and New Year, something very unDonald Trump, which is blatant - love our neighbor, whoever it is and rejoice we think how we do, and be grateful we find like minded people who still fight for right - right here in The NY Times comment section!  :)  That goes for you, Christine.

If the contradictions related here were faced perhaps we would not be in this boat.  China and other Asian nations are meritocracies where testing determines in large measure Government positions and entrance to Universities making well paying jobs more likely.   The U.S. has today minimal opportunities for non college graduate.   China has taken first our low wage jobs and now our Engineering Jobs along with India as it does not pay to manufacture here.   They will soon not ship much back here as that there will not be enough productive workers to pay for the foreign goods.  Tariffs and VATs worldwide protect more savvy economies like Germany protect their labor force via underselling by wage slave labor.   Liberals have never faced directly the costs as well as benefits of free trade.   Alexander Hamilton had a protectionist solution which worked for a long time as it kept jobs and Engineering here based on the then world dominant education system.   After world war II protectionism was unnecessary and dropped.   We have engaged in a race to the bottom wagewise and the economy has showed this.  We need an intelligent industrial and trade policy.  I hope this can work but the voice of academic economists say it won't.  Time will tell.  One cannot blame Trump for trying.",

							"commentBody": "Actually, although economics itself is a subject worthy of study, macroeconomics has not performed well in the last few years.<br/><br/>The reason is that practitioners want to talk about important things, and received accolades from the power structure.  Krugman for example was perhaps angling for a position in a Clinton administration.  So they bowdlerize their subject to make it more appealing to one of the flavors of politicians.<br/><br/>Krugman excoriates those economists with a conservative bent and provides his own version of Keynesianism.<br/><br/>Make no mistake.  Keynes was an important economist and his ideas have merit.  But in the hands of Krugman those ideas are subordinated to politics.<br/><br/>When it comes to trade policy, yes, free trade has benefited the wealthy, but not so much the white patriarchs, vilified by the left, who were once the backbone of the American middle class.<br/><br/>Krugman is clueless about this demonization of forgotten Americans.  They have spoken by voting for Trump.<br/><br/>The antidote would be for liberalism to start actually supporting the poor, whose lives it claims to be concerned about.<br/><br/>A little less sanctimony and a little more honesty.<br/><br/>At least Trump says up front that he will s***w the little guy.<br/><br/>Liberals proclaim that they want to help the poor, then provide Obamacare which has not stopped the exponential rise in health care costs.<br/><br/>Both parties lie, but the Democratic lies are the more preposterous.",
