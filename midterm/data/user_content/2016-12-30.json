				"commentBody": "Norm, I have a college degree, but for the money and benefits I did \"mind-numbing work\" in a UAW-represented auto factory for 30 years. Better wage package than anything my degree would have gotten me.  You'd maybe be surprised out there in San Francisco what people would be willing to do for a living... if you pay them enough. You're right... minimum wage won't cut it. But if you pay people well, they will pay a lot more for that iPhone. <br/><br/>I think Trump is lying through his teeth when he says he is going to bring jobs back; he's too much in bed with other billionaires to truly give a whit about the wages of the lower classes. If workers are going to survive this global race to the bottom, they're going to have to resort, I fear, to the methods employed during the 1930s as far as activism and unrest. Trump soon will tire of the populism that brought him to the White House and will turn on his voters with a vengeance.",

This was selective hacking of just one party, why didn't they hack the RNC to reveal all the muck that was being said about Trump? Of course this is imperative that the Russians are disciplined and that too enough to hurt them so badly that they will not resort to such sly tricks again.",
