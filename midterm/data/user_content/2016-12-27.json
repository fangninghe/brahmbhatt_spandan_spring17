				"commentBody": "Still denying to take responsibility of what you westerners have done and deflecting the blame on chinese government again? So unoriginal. Your continuing attempt to make china crumble is all too conspicuous. China does not need to resort to conspiracy theories to prop itself up: just one look at Trump is enough to make average chinese laugh at the west and their democracy. The real glaring failures are the western democracies, the problems china is facing pales in comparison to america and western europe's.<br/> I remember the western educated korean democracy advocates demanding the fall of the military junta, the junta that finally lifted koreans from poverty and protected them from north, and when the military did step down those democracy activists gutted the economy and unleashed pro north korean sympathizers into the streets. Korea is only a shadow of its glory days: the country is overrun by pro north activists with unemployment sky high and cost of living soaring. The chinese government is not going to let the same thing happen in their country.",

Yes, the Palestinians should have a state of their own in which they would also enjoy majority rule, but they will not achieve it through continuous \"wars of aggression\" against their Israeli Neighbors.<br/><br/>Successive \"wars of aggression\" against Israel, all of which have failed, and refusal to negotiate \"secure and recognized boundaries\" for both states per UNSCR 242 and 338, have resulted in continued \"occupation\" of captured and disputed territory. Under International Law, Israel as the victorious belligerent of the 1967 \"Six Day War,\" is entitled to retain captured land until possession is modified by peace treaty.

I was poor in the 60/70's and even then the Democrats were trying to help out with job programs  for teenagers (Job Opportunities for Youth and CETA and others).  The Republicans were against all of those programs and cut them as soon as they got power.  Republicans are against college support and health care, child care, and help for small business, etc. etc.  Their attitude is \"you are on your own! They believe in trickle down economics, help the rich make more money and somehow that is going to help the rest of us-- right!  Luckily for many of us, there were more opportunities back in the 80's. But today, no help and the competition has exploded. Political correctness is about being polite.  Do the people who voted for Trump -- against their interests want liberals to keep calling them idiots?  How about we just say they needed a voice.  That is what political correctness is about.  It is about being polite and learning how to communicate in a way that's not offensive to other people!  ",
