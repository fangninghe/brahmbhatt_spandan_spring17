Yes?<br/>I've had the green check since late 2012 but began posting comments much earlier, whenever it was that the NYT opened articles to comments.  I remember posting frequently to Bob Herbert's op-eds and those were the comments of mine that often garnered many recommendations.<br/>Sometime in 2012, the NYT invited me to become a green check commenter(not their terminology).

If elected she is a danger to the United States and in many ways, as noted in the article, will run to the right of Trump on military intervention. Trump has indicated he \"has not even started on Hillary yet\" and her consistent hawkish positions and terrible public perception may pose real dangers to the Democrats if she runs. Worst, if she is elected, we may find the United States involved in another senseless war.   One legislator, who worked with Clinton for years, noted  that there \u201chasn\u2019t been a military engagement that Hillary has not been for in the past 20 years.\u201d Clinton\u2019s saber-rattling history and positions should give the voters and Democrats very serious concerns.

				"commentBody": "Hillary Clinton is a dangerous cocktail. She is fueled by personal ambition using foreign policy to achieve these ends. As the article shows, along with her personal entourage of hawk generals antithetical to the administration's foreign policy objectives, she single-handedly derailed President Obama's very intelligently put-together decisions and achievements with respect to this region, embroiling our nation and others in a scenario even more difficult to extricate &amp; resolve.<br/><br/>Senator Sanders has great support from American troops and veterans based on his record and achievements in Congress.  He is also endorsed by the largest U.S. peace organization, Peace Action, their 1st Presidential candidate endorsement in 25 years. He has integrity, a characteristic clearly foreign to Clinton's psyche.<br/><br/>Former President Jimmy Carter, who is also a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his work with the Carter Center, straightforwardly said that Hillary Clinton did very little for peace during her time in the State Department. That, current U.S. Sec of State John Kerry has done much more to advance those aims.<br/><br/>Clinton shoots from the belt, she's highly arrogant, &amp; she's taking too much money from interests antithetical to the American People and the USA. She even used her State Department position to swap 165 billion dollars in arms to foreign governments contributing to their bogus \"foundation.\" The Saudis &amp; UAE - grave human rights offenders, among her Presidential campaign contributors.",

Once it was crossed we were all lucky that Obama made an agreement to get most of the chemical weapons out of Syria without a war.  Then we were even luckier that Obama was able to come to a decent agreement with Iran on nuclear weapons.  The objective wasn't to make Netanyahu happy or turn Iran into a democracy, it was to prevent a regional war in the Middle East.  I think it worked, and we should be grateful to Obama and everyone who helped bring this about.",
