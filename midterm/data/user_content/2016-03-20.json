Whether that is collateral damage is debatable.<br/><br/>However, using drones outside of war zones or in clandestine operations is immoral and unconstitutional. Areas where drones are used must be declared war zones, and use of drones must be approved by the Congress. That will set us on a moral high ground to preach and deter other countries and rogue nations from abusing this powerful technology.",

Both parties have played their part in the destruction of the economic and social life of the majority of American in their varying roles in widening the gulf between haves, have less and have nots.  There's nothing Republicans won't give to taker Corporations, to subsidize stock manipulators and nothing they won't take from everyone else.  I don't know that Jack Kemp made any lasting contribution to the philosophy or practice of governance and Paul Ryan, in my view, is a laughable tyro.  Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, Eric Cantor and Paul Ryan are the bacilli that grew the tumor of paralysis.  Donald J. Trump is an outcome as was Hitler because of the paralysis of Weimar Germany.  The commonweal has been left to rot and drift and that tills the soil for growing the totalitarian plant.",

Most fathers use the excuse of work to treat their families like accessories and prefer to hang with the guys playing golf or indulging their drug of choice.  Equally strange is your notion of schools being ideal, nurturing environments for kids.  Must be why we spend billions trying to combat bullying, reduce horrendous drop out rates, fight drug abuse and once or twice a year shake our heads when one of the fun kids comes with an UZI and sprays murder and mayhem.  And that's before actual educational issues such as schools that simply warehouse kids and they come out functionally illiterate.  Majority of comments today reflect men who feel defensive about their sham relationship to their families and feel better twisting a caring father's decision into some dark perversity.
