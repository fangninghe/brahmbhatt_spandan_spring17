Isolationism, bigotry, fear of foreigners will possibly slow it slightly, but will not stop a necessary evolution. If we are to survive as a human kind, we must come together globally, protect our planet, feed all people and accept our global commonalities and responsibilities and cooperate. It seems the early 21st century may go down in history as the last gasp and desperate grab of the old world trying to hold on to cultural purity, antiquated traditions and superiority complexes.

The kicking and screaming may lead to guns and bombs and the human race may obliterate itself rather than embrace its necessary oneness.<br/>Brexit, Trump, Putin, Fundalmental Islamics - this is the old world digging its feet into the sand, lying, bullying, murdering in an attempt not to move.

Or right for some people, but not others.<br/><br/>The book that I've recommended was very thought provoking for me on several fronts.<br/><br/>1. It positions \"collapse\" as a normal process of simplifying/reducing unsustainable complexity.  Unlike many theories of collapse, it rejects the more common morality-based explanations.  In other words, it can be read from an almost non-partisan, \"scientific\" perspective.<br/><br/>2. It points out that \"collapse\" has different impacts on different parts of society. For example, it claims that segments of Roman society actually welcomed the \"barbarians\", because they essentially offered a \"better deal\" than the Roman elites.<br/><br/>3.  It compares the collapse of several different civilizations, not just the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>4. It examines and challenges a range of common collapse theories.<br/><br/>It is only one of many books on the topic, but should be of great interest to anyone trying to make sense of the world today.",

Referendums don't hold real power, that belongs with Parliament.<br/><br/>When people wake up tomorrow and realize that Brexit means Scexit (Scotland leaving) and Scexit means the end of the UK, it could trigger a vote of no-confidence in the government (if pro-remain Tories voted along side Labor). This might happen - but it means putting country before party for those Tories, and ironically, Cameron would be one of those voting against the government. <br/><br/>In the meantime, Cameron would have to step down in favor of a pro-Brexit MP. <br/><br/>A vote of no confidence would mean a new general election. In that election a vote for Tories means REAL brexit but also means dissolving the country for real.  We can assume that the destruction of the UK would cause many patriotic tories to vote Labor on that one. A Labor lead government would never leave the EU. <br/><br/>That Labor lead coalition would also have to make deals with Scotish nationalist for a more Federated form of UK. That is probably fitting. <br/><br/>Meanwhile we can expect some fallout over on the EU side too leading to a more Confederated EU. That is probably more fitting as well.<br/><br/>The EU was probably 150 years ahead of its time and should go back to being a European Community or EC. <br/><br/>Since the French Revolution, NO national identity has been willing to settle for anything other than self government. That's a hard reality of history that the EU has run into. The Eurocrats got WAY too far out ahead of themselves.  ",
