And the investigations are done for the benefit of folks like you to swallow at l;least enough to be confused over what the problems are and the causes.  And the investigations with their witch hunt style questions that do not even care about the answers, but just want to plant the seed of doubt and mistrust in their questions, have produced nothing except this effect among the gullible, especially when combined with relentless distorted attack ads.  And while doing this they have hugely wasted time and taxpayer cost and Congressional resources.  <br/><br/>And the Republicans are sadly rightly confident the media and extreme internet sites will will pick and advance their aims.  These Republicans who believe they have nothing better to do, like finding solutions incredibly pressing problems, than obstruct the work of the government the admit they hate and want to fail.  Any former Republican who now calls himself a Libertarian has that same anti government philosophy.  and if you think less government corporate regulation, social, consumer and environment protections and isolationist foreign policies are what is needed to deal with the complicated problems we face then you are pat of the problem.",

The inequity in the socio-economic status of students and families is the greatest factor.

Mainstreaming has great social value but only if students have the skills to participate readily in learning with their peers. We have become a test-driven nation to the detriment of learning.",

You don't get good test results by constantly testing students. You have to actually teach them.<br/><br/>Ms Ravich doesn't have anything useful to suggest here except vague \"focus\", but throwing more money at mismanaged schools with weak teachers will accomplish nothing. We know, for example, that class sizes are, within limits, not very important to what students learn. What matters is the skill of the teachers and the engagement of the parents. The best 25% of teachers teach 3 times as much as the worst 25%. But the educational establishment fights tooth and nail against any real attempt to improve the quality of teachers.",

It's also true that schools with 20% poverty or less, rank with the highest performing schools in the world on the international PISA exams.  <br/><br/>So, to say that most public schools in this country are bad is an inaccurate generalization. While many public schools in this country are pathetic, many public schools in this country are outstanding.  <br/><br/>What are the factors that account for these differences? Simply blaming teachers, and expecting them to compensate for all the challenges associated with poverty is  naive.  ",

If he thinks that making a question into an argument is law enforcement or is going to prove something he's wrong and he's right.  It's not law enforcement but he's proving to me that he can't handle a simple question.  Do I want that person on the street patrolling my village?  Does he know the difference between someone starting an argument and someone asking a question?<br/><br/>Now, expand that to what has been happening.  If the police are treating all of us like potential shooters or they are killing people even after the person says that they are licensed to carry but are reaching for their wallet, they can't expect us to be on their side no matter what color we are.  On the other hand, I do understand that they want to go home to their families at the end of their shift.  So did the innocent people they shot.  There has to be more community policing.  In addition, the NRA should not be listened to when it comes to guns.  The cops are right here:  if they have to worry about everyone carrying a gun because they can, it makes it hard for them to do their job.  Last of all, we should not be feeling that our police forces are occupying armies.  ",
