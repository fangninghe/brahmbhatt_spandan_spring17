							"commentBody": "It is shocking that in the medical sector, we pay astronomical costs for a very low quality product. It's a race to the bottom.  We would never overpay for a terrible product or go to an incompetent surgeon if there was transparency in medical care quality and medical billing.  Transparency would weed out incompetent, dishonest doctors with out-of-date skills and reduce medical costs via enabling consumers to comparison price shop for medical care. My surgeon was a medical fraud who instead of performing the consented to and long planned modern, minimally-invasive surgery, just did an old-fashioned, open procedure, butcher job for no medical or anatomical reason. She did it because she fraudulently misrepresented her skills and experience. My surgeon's hospital then billed thousands of dollars to my health insurance company for the unused laparoscopic surgery tools and materials that just sat in the OR in their wrapping while my doctor butchered me with her scalpel, breaching my consent. Medical fraud and malpractice have enormous unnecessary costs. When patients are injured, the irony is that they must then pay all the enormous medical bills to treat the iatrogenic injuries. The worse the quality of care, the more doctors, medical groups, and hospitals make. ",

				"commentBody": "I often reflect on property ownership as I drive along the beautiful lakes and waterways where I live and must strain to find a view among the competing architectural altars to each owner's success story. Small slivers of \"public access\" points do exist, but are pathetically inadequate. <br/><br/>Homeowners along one lake took it upon themselves to appropriate publicly-owned former railroad land along one entire side of a lake, and when the county initiated plans to convert the rails to a trail for public use, the homeowners were enraged that their illegally appropriated public property was repatriated, and that the \"public\" would be walking near their waterfront homes. They became so aggressive, that County officials brought police with them when they went to survey the property.<br/><br/>The rapid appropriation and sense of entitlement by the elites of our most scenic areas--and political influence that allowed this, is a tragic visual reminder of our rapidly failing Democracy.",

				"commentBody": "In defense of WADA, WADA was not even formed until November 10, 1999  and were not a functioning body until 2002. You can blame the IOC for Andreea Raducan's 2000 loss of a gold medal but not WADA. I would blame Andreea's  doctor for this disqualification. WADA did fund the Independent Commission's investigation of Russia which led to Russia Track and Field being suspended and presently ineligible for the 2016 Olympics. The Independent Commission investigation also led to indictment against former IAAF president Lamine Diack. I do not call these actions \"distractions\" in the battle against doping. The second half of the Commission's investigation is yet to be released. It should be noted that  the Independent Commission recommends WADA develop and implement a whistleblower assistance and protection policy. As you state most doping scandals are uncovered by insiders (whistleblower). I see WADA as the only entity working toward reducing the stranglehold that doping has on sports world wide. ",

I see more fat bellies and butts on sunday anymore than  you can shake a stick at. if many of them just lost 15# of body fat they'd be better players. the guy deadlifting 405# in the website pic is where we non-pros all want to go. and some of us can still do it too without drugs.",

				"commentBody": "Right now his wife's HIPPA  protection is what is keeping the NFL from linking Manning to HGH. Yes I believe he would have it sent to his wife. If he were innocent do you think his wife's medical privacy concerns would be worth giving up his multi million dollar public image and his entry into the hall of fame? Lets see Ashley's  medical records and explanation for using HGH. Or even have a reliable third party review of Ashley records to verify they are valid without disclosing details. We need a few key football players to stand up to the drug culture in the NFL,  get real testing  that would clean up the NFL and allow a drug free player to compete. Looks like Manning is not the standup guy that I was hoping for. Maybe the next player that gets implicated will be the guy I am looking for that will out the NFL drug culture. ",
