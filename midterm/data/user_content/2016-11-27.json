				"commentBody": "Trump's populism is not dependent upon economics, economic class, or policy positions.<br/><br/>This election demonstrated that the Republican base is indifferent to sexual scandals, financial chicanery, and overt expressions of racism by their candidates.  Forget about the shallow pretensions of the 'Moral Majority' of yesteryear - Trump has demolished the last remnants of that facade. <br/><br/>The Republican base voted for an Attitude, with little expectation of any actual results from their candidate. Rhetoric is more important than results. That attitude is a snarling, free-floating cynicism that borders on outright nihilism that has become the core of their identity as Americans. <br/><br/>The Confederacy thrives on rejecting the Union, or the 'establishment' in today's terminology. The Civil War continues, and to no good or meaningful end. ",

				"commentBody": "What the GOP has learned over the past decade is that compromise is not rewarded by voters or the media. Instead, being a true opposition party that sets its own agenda and fights every step of the way is the path to victory. <br/><br/>It is time for the Democrats in the Senate and elsewhere to learn that lesson and flip the script on the GOP.  Do not enable, normalize, or compromise with the phony populist con man who lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes yet will be our next President, and do not compromise with or enable the Koch Brothers' GOP lackeys in the Senate and House. Instead, Democrats must set forth their own populist progressive economic agenda, and fight the coming Republican efforts to privatize Medicare and Social Security, destroy ObamaCare and public education, and line the pockets of billionaires. If Trump or other Republicans want to come across the aisle and support part of our agenda, great. But don't water down our message or normalize the Republicans by constantly chasing compromises with the GOP that always turn out badly for us. <br/><br/>Infrastructure is a case in point. Trump's \"plan\" is simply a corporate tax giveaway to finance toll roads. Democrats must oppose that, and offer actual infrastructure investments instead, rather than trying to tweak Trump's plan to make it slightly less bad. The path to victory is standing up and fighting, not weak compromising.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive</a> ",

				"commentBody": "Trump is, and always has been, a con man plain and simple. Certainly, his appointment of a bunch of billionaires and millionaires to his cabinet is one sign that his entire \"populist\" shtick was nothing but a con. But far bigger proof that it was just a con comes from the policies that Trump and the rest of the Republicans are going to be pursuing.<br/><br/>Privatizing Medicare would increase costs and reduce coverage for middle class Americans. It would also enrich a bunch of health insurance companies. <br/><br/>Privatizing Social Security would eviscerate retirement security for tens of millions of Americans, but would be a huge gift to Wall Street.<br/><br/>DeVos' education proposals are all about helping the private sector gain access to all of the money that goes into education.<br/><br/>The GOP's desire to kneecap the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would put a halt to that bureau's work protecting consumers against corporate and financial fraud, which has already saved consumers $12 billion.<br/><br/>Trump's infrastructure \"plan\" wouldn't fund any infrastructure projects. Instead, it would provide more than $100 billion in corporate tax giveaways in an effort to encourage privately-funded toll roads and bridges.<br/><br/>None of this should come as a surprise from Trump who spent decades outsourcing jobs, fighting unions, and refusing to pay his contractors. Let's just hope voters realize that they have been conned sooner rather than later.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/WinningProgressive</a>",

Paul Ryan has had his knives out for years to eliminate Medicare and leave seniors with inadequate vouchers to try to get insurance from the health insurance industry. Republicans have fought the Consumers Financial Protection Bureau since the day it was created, and Trump said during the campaign that he would eliminate it. And the corporate tax giveaway that pretends to be an infrastructure \"plan\" is exactly what Trump proposed.<br/><br/>These are all things that we may be able to stop, but only if we organize against the agenda that the Republicans have long said they plan to pursue, and stand in firm opposition to them. We may lose some, or even all, of those fights, but the Democratic position on these issues must be full opposition - no surrender, no retreat. ",

His first term hasn't started yet and I will give it four years before I make a final judgement, but I don't expect it will change. If under Trump, the country improves from where it was as of Dec 31, 2016, then he can claim some of the credit. <br/><br/>Compare where the country was when Bush 2 started to when he left by various metrics. It's going to be worse in 2020 and 2024, if we go that long with a Republican administration. It's not all on the President but in terms of partial credit, the buck stops there. <br/><br/>I don't really care much for the Democrats either, and I agree they have gotten too cozy with the professional and elite classes, but they are better than the Republicans for this country at least as far as this century is concerned.

SF, Seattle and Honolulu is where I started eating Thai food at some of the best restaurants. I was sad when I moved back east and had been served not so good fare over and over. Many people on the east coast had never experienced good Thai so did not know any different, similar to this writer.<br/>You can tell when a restaurant skimps on real ingredients and uses poor quality. Most Thai places are going the way of Chinese, who BTW now own and operate many supposedly Thai restaurants. ",

When was there ever an age, since the beginning of time, that didn\u2019t feature more than one famous man? Until now, no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome. Now, though, in all of Rome, there\u2019s room for only one man.
