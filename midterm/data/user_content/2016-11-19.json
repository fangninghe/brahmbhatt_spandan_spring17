Brushing aside his ignorant proclamations, misogynistic outbursts and racist rants. And now, Mitt Romney who warned in March that to chose Trump for President \"the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished\", comes in search of an appointment. Is there no level they will not stoop to?<br/>What an unseemly spectacle!",

And occasionally if they did survive, a few would default on the agreement, refusing to give up land and bribing the law to look the other way.<br/><br/>But no matter anyway, the subject of slavery is ancient history and it has no place in modern society, at least not a civilized one. Unless people accept what happened and move on, we can never have true equality. What happened was a terrible injustice, but it was done by people who have long since been dead to people who have long since been dead.<br/><br/>Affirmative action works on the basis that minorities are incompetent, and need the support of whites in order to succeed. It doesn't matter the \"logic\" used to justify it, it's a racist system spawned from the desperation of wanting NOT to appear racist.<br/><br/>It's far more logical to have an Affirmative Action based on income, as this gives poor kids of every race a chance, instead of just the minority ones, who could still actually be rich and benefit from the AA.<br/>(Ultimately I agree that indentured servants are not slaves, but they are comparable.)",

They don't hate gay people, they just don't want them around.  They harbor no hatred of black people.  They just want to throw people in jail for 20 years for smoking a joint.  They don't hate Mexicans, they just want to make sure any that have lived here for 20+ years and have raised children here get deported. <br/><br/>It's all about policy, not race.

The are willing to die for it, to cut down mountain tops , pollute the streams, make the fields and forests unusable. <br/><br/>They did not stop the destruction of their environment, when the coal companies wanted to dig more or drill more, only a few stood up and demanded more responsible mining.The put up with unsafe working conditions, black lung disease, and all the other illnesses that come with mining it. They forewent medical plans, let the coal barons get rid of the unions, caved in to the threats of being put out of work.<br/><br/>so now, the work is gone, the water undrinkable, the forests and mountain tops gone, the streams polluted, a classic case of short sighted thinking. They did not encumber their minds with thinking, they left them blank, believing it would last forever. <br/><br/>Now it has become a dinosaur, expensive to use, dirty, and inefficient. they blame environmentalists.  But California set the example when it outlawed coal burning trains in the late 1800s pr early 1900s. California was fortunate to have large oil reserves, the people and legislators understood the how damaging it was then.<br/><br/>Of course the coal industry promoted as much use of it as it could, now it is being replaced by cleaner power sources. Those citizens of Appalachia helped bring it on themselves, they have no one else to blame. It is they , who let the coal companies have their way, now they are paying the price.",

Similar things are said about a lot of class-oppressed people. It\u2019s easy to just say \u201cfix yourself\u201d. It\u2019s ironically what \"progressives\" and (I guess this is what you might call them) \"atavistics\" both prescribe. Like all those homeless folks in San Francisco, African Americans in Compton and Oakland, Native Americans all over the state and nation, Mexican Americans that have to listen to how you say things like San Rafael and nevertheless own the place, and on and on.  Your attitude is also weirdly violent; as reactionary as the folks who voted \"wrong\" and act out too. Make no mistake, you prescribe that harm come to others here. They deserve to be harmed you say. You say they are others, other than you and yours. But the people of Appalachia are various. They are people, and Americans, as well as you. Odd to have to remind both sides in this kind of mutual sneering of that central fact. The conditions in Appalachia and the exploitation of the place and people are also various, not all dystopian but too often bad, the worst of it well documented but not really understood. Certainly not by you here. This country is worth the work. The wrecking ball of balkanism is always attractive to angry people. We have a right to be pretty angry right now, but so do these people that have been misled and railroaded for so long. It\u2019s time now for good work to be done.",

These folks are not saints, they are professionals.   He won, by the rules of the electoral college. I'm tempted to say that it's not my America, but it is our reality, and I still live here, although my commitment to our republic is growing burdensome.  Retreating from globalization is a natural reaction for most of us in the middle, but it's only postponing the inevitable. The old white guys in charge will have their last stand. It may echo for some decades, but ultimately it is a loosing proposition. God bless the Republic. ",

However, slowly it looks like Rene Redzepi is loosing the plot gallivanting all over the world with his pop-up restaurants.  I'm sure it is great fun for him and his staff but to me his uniqueness has peaked sometime back, and other and better restaurants have now taken advantage of his lack of focus.  My new favourite in Copenhagen the 3-star Geranium Restaurant is a good example. ",

She knew about Johnson and Stein. She had the best and brightest on her team -- the Ivy Leaguers. She had the quants and the analysts. She had $1.5 BILLION war chest to spend as she wished, on staff and on travel and on constant advertising.<br/><br/>I live in a swing state, so I got to see ALL of her advertising -- nothing positive, it was all Trump attack ads, using snippets of his most controversial statements. It backfired on her. It was supposed to create outrage, especially amongst women voters, but I think it became so negative and numbing, that it had the opposite effect. (In contrast, Trump's ads were very muted and positive with a \"Morning In America\" tone. And he ran only a small number, even at the end. She had to have outspent him by a factor of 12 to 1.)<br/><br/>The reality is the Hillary effed up. There is no way around this. She knew this was about the Electoral College. She knew she needed every Midwestern state. She's a poor campaigner. Her staff massaged her ego and fed her lies. The lefty media colluded with her campaign, in ways that are yet to come out. The voters smelled a rat, and voted accordingly.<br/><br/>Oh and \"Debbie Wasserman Schultz\". That woman is pure evil.",
