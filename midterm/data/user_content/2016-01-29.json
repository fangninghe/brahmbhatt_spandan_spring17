					"commentBody": "The doc wasn't biased at all?  Then when mentioning the cat incident why didn't they mention that he had first poured gas on the cat and thrown it in the fire instead of letting it slide that he was tossing the cat and it just happened to catch fire?  The interrogation of Dassey was an atrocity?  You realize that they showed like 3 minutes out of a 4 hour interview right?  You do also realize that he went into a ton of detail about what happened including detail that matched the physical evidence?  So asking him questions and saying they didn't feel he was being honest is an atrocity?  How exactly would you expect an interrogation to go then?<br/><br/>Then 'unbiased' doc also cut out part of the phone conversation that Dassey had with his mom where he tells her that he was afraid of Avery and that Avery had sexual abused him and another family member before.  They showed part of this conversation on the doc, so what other reason would they have to not include that portion of the conversation other than to not make Avery look worse?  <br/><br/>Or how about the blood vial with the hole in it?  The doc left out the part of the trial where it's explained that these vials are supposed to have holes in them because they poke the needle into the hole to get the blood into them.  What reason would there be to leave that part out other than to leave the thought in the head of the viewer that the vial had been tampered with?  There's plenty more besides that even.  ",

					"commentBody": "Actually his initial confession lined up with a lot of the physical evidence.  They didn't use his confession at the trial because in order to use it the defense would have the right to cross examine him, and since he refused to make a deal to testify against Avery and was not saying that he lied during the confession the prosecution couldn't exactly call him to testify.  That's not to mention that Dassey had his own trial coming up after this one.  Amazing that yet another person who watched the documentary doesn't have their facts straight... And you're complaining that someone is getting all of their information for Nancy Grace and didn't watch the documentary?  That's pretty ironic considering most of the Avery supporters know nothing about this case other than what they saw on the documentary.  Maybe the original poster has just actually taken the time to read more into the case?  Maybe he's seen/heard the actual confession from Dassey instead of just the few minutes shown on the documentary that were designed to make you think he didn't actually say anything?  ",
