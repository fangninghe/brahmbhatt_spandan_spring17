				"commentBody": "A huge mistake was made several decades ago, when the Equal Rights Amendment was almost passed. Had the Women's Movement at that time called for a draft of all, including women, it is likely the amendment would have picked up the few more states needed. People understand viscerally that genuine equality means not just an equal chance to be President or a C.E.O., but an equal chance to die serving one's country.<br/><br/>In any case, this country needs a draft for practical reasons as well as reasons of fairness and justice. Only by having a draft will we ensure that almost everyone has some skin in the game when we go off to war. Only by having a draft will it become likely that those who have never served will send other people's kids off to die, while their own are sheltered. Only by having a draft will we guarantee substantial opposition to wars that are not really popular. <br/><br/>Let us remember that what really crystallized anti-war efforts during the Viet Nam War and turned them into a mass movement that disrupted business as usual was the draft reaching into the middle class.",

				"commentBody": "I used to work in a long-term care hospital. An elderly male patent was transported to the exercise room in his wheelchair. He was moderately, but pleasantly, demented and spoke little, and he usually participated slowly with simple exercises. <br/><br/>That day, he sat quietly and seemed highly attentive to some unseen presence in the room. His expression changed into a beautiful, joyful smile, and he lifted his arms wide, as if accepting some glorious light and love pouring down upon him. He remained entranced in this manner for several minutes, seeming unaware of gentle staff questions, \"Can you tell us what you see?\" <br/><br/>He had not been particularly ill, but he died peacefully in his sleep a day or two later.

I would be pleased if someone I cared about told me that he or she saw a deceased friend or relative visiting, or waiting. You want a dying person to feel happy, loved, and cared for. What could be better than to know that the person has friends on the other side (or believes that to be so)? I would hope only that what was seen was not upsetting in any way.<br/><br/>When my father was dying he saw things from when he was serving in WWII. Not horrible things, as far as I could determine, but things of wonder. It was definitely delirium.  It was alarming to see at first, but I was glad that he could step away from the awfulness of the present. It made sense that he would travel back to the prime of his life, when he encountered things not seen before. It did bother me a little that the time travel was to a period well before I -- or any of my siblings -- existed. But at the time I was still very young.",

				"commentBody": "Nate, I'd offer third explanation for the disparity between the polls and the final results:<br/><br/>I don't think you have taken into account the psychology at play. When a Trump is sitting in isolation in their house, they may well feel very strongly that they support him. But when you get out among the broader population of voters and suddenly discover that the solid majority is very much opposed to Trump, that could very quickly change.<br/><br/>I remember observing some open discussions around polling places. Perhaps it's not proper or shouldn't be allowed, but this *does* happen, even during the General election: people discuss their votes nearby. Now in the much more informal caucus setting, a lot of people were probably chatting, and getting a sense for how others are voting. Rest assured that some disparaging things were said about this or that candidate. In that scenario, unfavorability becomes especially important, and Trump's persuasiveness likely faded.",

Also, the Olympic Games should not be hosted in Rio because of this virus.  Not only is the Zika virus difficult to detect, it also has modes of transmission that is hard to control (mosquitoes and sex).  Attracting tens of millions of people to an area known to harbor the Zika virus would not be a good idea.  However, there is about 6 months until the Olympic Games so there could be a solution before then.  ",
