				"commentBody": "Sadly, those who truly need medication and who are not abusing dosages are being penalized in my state of Washington.   My physician agreed with me when I met with him recently that those who overuse prescription drugs are making it much harder for those patients who are being responsible.   His fear is that with the state watching so carefully, his license will be revoked even if he is prescribing medication in moderate amounts to those who do not abuse.<br/><br/>Clearly there is a crisis of epidemic proportions with prescription drug use, but the law should be made clear that those who use medication properly, diligently and without abusing, should not be penalized by overzealousness.    There are many in our nation who suffer daily with significant pain.   There should be a case by case evaluation of each patient and that patient\u2019s needs, as well as the patient's adherence to reasonable dosages of medication needed.    In my state at least, this is not happening and many are being cut off of all medication, some without receiving any prior notice at all.    <br/><br/>According to our Department of Health, doctors are not required to cut people off medication, that physicians do have the right to make determinations about what medications and dosages are appropriate.   But as my long time doctor advised me, there is real fear among physicians now of losing their licenses despite the state\u2019s assurance.   There has to be a sane, humane solution for this so people are seen as individuals.",

We will come away with not knowing where either of these people stand; it the GOP debates were any indication. Honestly, Ms. Clinton trying to say she has GOP leanings, with liberal leanings, with middle of the road leanings? Yo need a score card just to know where she leans today.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, Ms. Clinton will move to right of center, in the debates, and try to be more Republican than Mr. Trump.  Ronald Reagan must be rolling in his grave.<br/><br/>Of course, many Trump and Sanders supporters already know Ms. Clinton will say, and do anything, to get elected. So, she is going to trump Trump. That is, be something Paul Ryan,, Dick Cheney, GW Bush and Lindsey Graham will be proud of. She may be able to even impress Ted Cruz. That strategy may send Democrats away in drives.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump will stay on point. That may actually help him.<br/><br/>As for those who were hoping for real change, and members of the 99%, Ms. Clinton will make Mr. Obama look like FDR in comparison. Of course, maybe voters will see through the Clinton charade and vote for someone else.",

For many months, the primaries seemed entertaining. No one really believed that the North American people would vote for such a buffoon. But now it has happened and one can only make jokes, as you do here, about the establishment political class cueing up to compete to be Mr. Trump's vice president.  We had seen \"The Apprentice\" on cable TV.  Now politics is imitating reality TV and we  will witness the spectacle of  a stream of  U.S. politicians waiting to kiss Mr. Trump's ring. From here, it's hard to discern whether it is the Republican Party which is committing suicide before our very eyes, or whether the US electorate has lost its collective mind and might even elect Trump as President. If it is the latter,  don't expect the world to be supportive.  We are repulsed and we will not play along.  All of Latin America will rise up and say no to Trump's insulting wall and his bigoted rhetoric.  Donald Trump, the ultimate Ugly American, will have recast the entire country into his own image. Let's hope that reason will somehow prevail and sanity restored in the US electorate.",

In order to debate, a person has to have something in their heads.  He is the ultimate know nothing.  All he can do is hurl insults and repeat slogans over and over again. <br/><br/>She knows how to handle spoiled children that throw tantrums when they don't get their way.  She knows how to maintain dignity and act like a president.  She also knows how to chop Trump into pieces if opens his big mouth at her.<br/><br/>Ten minutes into the first debate, she will expose him for the fool that he is.  His competitors in the GOP contest were unable to do so because they were bigger fools than he is.  They crawled down into the sewer with him.  Didn't work. <br/><br/>Hillary is no ones fool.  She can handle him.     ",

And there's a bit of verbal excess in your  words \"They crawled down into the sewer with him.\" The last I checked, only Marco Rubio stands guilty of hurling Trump-like filth into the Republican campaign.<br/><br/> Even Ted Cruz, loathsome though he was and remains for his ideas, came nowhere near Trump in this respect, though he did  throw the justifiable epithet \"pathological liar\" at Trump . And despite their many other weaknesses, the rest of the Republican challengers, most notably John Kasich, Chris Christy, and Ben Carson, refused to dip their hands in slime.<br/><br/>Donald Trump has proven to be an unusual eel that no hands  nor any net has caught yet.  His opponents are impatient to destroy him, but my hope, not entirely unrealistic, is that he will self-destruct in the months to come . His tax returns should they become public; any sordid tales from his private life; and most of all an indictment for fraud in his for-profit \" university\"  could individually or collectively  undo him even before any debates.<br/><br/> If he barely survives all that due to court-room stalling , he will still have been softened up for a crushing blow from any Democratic or third-party ticket.",
