(Yet access to Trump will get you what?) That line wasn't a throwaway, she says nothing the Trump/Mercer braintrust don't devise in advance.<br/><br/>Both Kellyanne Conway and Steve Bannon were until recently (?) employed by New York hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, Conway running his Ted Cruz SuperPAC and Bannon running his Breitbart site.<br/><br/>Mercer also just happens to be principal investor in Cambridge Analytica, the big-data firm that targets voters based on their psychological profiles. Gee, ya think? Cambridge was Trump's pollster, so some of Mercer's tens of millions in donations to Trump have already found their way back home.<br/><br/>Cambridge Analytica's previous success was the Brexit campaign, which Mercer won by ginning up the racist nationalist turnout, furthered by Breitbart's UK site. Mercer funds similar nationalist movements in France, Italy and elsewhere.<br/><br/>Mercer's a tax evader ($7 billion) who wants to abolish the IRS. He funds climate denial and wants John Bolton as Secretary of State.<br/><br/>Trump fans who think they're getting unadulterated Trump and voted against the candidate they are told was corrupt and in favor of a \"global world order\" may be surprised to learn we're getting that on a scale we've never seen.",

In the 90s, the NYT studied the most popular article types and topics; naturally, my professor asked to see her reader\u2019s preferences.  She was told no; the NYT\u2019s editors are professionals of the highest caliber, and they were trusted to print what they considered newsworthy, not cater to readers\u2019 preferences.  I\u2019ve recently become very painfully aware of my personal echo chamber, that my social media network of friends and acquaintances are not representative of the national and global community in which I live.  At the same time, responsible journalism includes all sides of a story, but often irresponsible journalism tries to cover them all equally.  It\u2019s a difficult balance, but it\u2019s one I hope to see achieved.<br/>In an era of buzzfeed and facebook, the free press has come under immense pressure.  I\u2019ve decided that the only way forward is to disable my adblockers and sign up for a dead tree subscription of the NYT, rallying behind the courageous paper of record behind the Pentagon Papers and New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. ",

One angle that I'd like to see more of is the changing picture of the country as we rapidly become more diverse. The red vs the blue paradigm is fine but I'd like to see how that works as the younger, more diverse America is coming to the fore. The prevailing wisdom is that voters become more conservative as they get older. Does that belief apply across all racial, ethnic and geographical groups. How does it play out for the future Electoral College maps?",

All this emphasis on Clinton's emails, provided to us by the Russians &amp; wikileaks, when you could have been spending ten times as much coverage on the many problems of Donald Trump's actions, conflicts of interests, racism, etc.  Even today, where's the focus on Steve Bannon, a prominent white nationalist, and the many conflicts of interest between Trump's companies, Trump's children in possibly being involved in his companies &amp; his administration, &amp; getting to the bottom of Trump's international loans &amp; areas where he could be vulnerable to blackmail-like persuasion.   If there's one thing we've learned about Donald Trump in the past year, it's that his top priority is coming out on top, regardless of damage done to people who work for him or invest in his companies.  So I think it's reasonable to say he would sell out the American people or doing what is in the best interest of the United States in order to do what is best for him or his company.",
