				"commentBody": "To Alias:<br/>You are confusing between issues and issues. First, please look at the borders of Bangladesh (BD) with Myanmar. These two countries share very few miles of border. Myanmar borders India, so does BD. It is extremely unlikely that significant numbers of BD refugees in 1971 went to Myanmar - they didn't.<br/>Second, international borders like now are relatively recent phenomenon. There were always some Rohingyas in Myanmar, just as there are Nagas and others ethnically close to some Myanmar tribes in India. Rohingyas are predominantly Burmese citizens, or should be.<br/>Third, yes, during the British period some Indian Muslims from what is today's BD did go over to Myanmar and they were ethnically the same as the Rohingyas. But even that is a 100 yrs back. Hence by all accounts Rohingyas are people of the land of Myanmar.<br/>Now, I do not know if Suu Kyi is not keeping deliberately silent about the Rohingyas so as not to lose power, which would be disastrous for Myanmar, since power would shift to the military again. However, this should not prevent the rest of the world from putting pressure on Myanmar to stop its terrible ethnic cleansing practice.",

				"commentBody": "The lack of attention to the Rohingya in the U.S. media is the rule when it comes to S.E. Asia. (The exception is Al Jazeera, which has been broadcasting about the plight of the Rohingya for years.)<br/><br/>How much do most American know about the half million Indonesians who were killed after Suharto came to power in 1965? Or the needless deaths, estimated at 100,000, in East Timor over the two to three decades before it finally achieved its independence in 1999? The U.S. didn't just ignore these tragedies, but actively supported the wrong side.<br/><br/>Neither Indonesia's Bali nor Burma actually fits the comfortable narrative of exotic tourist destinations filled with spiritual, peaceful Hindu and Buddhist peoples. After the 1985 coup in Indonesia, 80,000 Balinese, five percent Bali's population, were killed (see Geoffrey Robinson's book, \"The Dark Side of Paradise\").<br/><br/>In Burma, the most outspoken advocates for violence against the Rohingya are Buddhist monks, who are no better than thugs. George Orwell, who as a young man was a colonial police officer in Burma, wrote with vigor about how much he disposed British colonialism, yet had very little kind to say about Burma's monks.<br/><br/>U.S. apathy toward, and ignorance of S.E. Asia has a way of coming back to bite us. Remember when the French were defeated in their colonial war by the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu in 1954? That one came back to haunt us, too.",

Also, remember that<br/>it wasn't that long ago that all these drugs were legal in the USA -- including<br/>cocaine infused teething rings for infants and . . .hello . . .Coca Cola had<br/>cocaine in it.

Only that germany is not in the middle of a uprising.<br/>And that also have nothing to do with religion, because devote muslim would not fill themself up with booze.<br/>It is much more simple - these are men with an inferiority complex, cowards, who don't want to fight for their country, but want to oppress someone else. Who have never learned to control their sexual desires. That's why they have to hide their women in a burqa.<br/><br/>It is appropriate to send them back - and we have every reason to blame the refugees on this. And this message is being delivered. Many arabians are really ashamed of what is happening on behalf of their society. They are still very much in denial, but an arabian shitstorm is growing.<br/><br/>Noone of us has some historical obligation to endure this behaviour, not even close. It is a simple matter of morality and decency between an hosting nation and their migrants. If we close they doors we just have to assure this one message, that this is the migrants very own failure.",

The rubes do not believe they are prosperous anymore, and there go the Republicans and their stupid excuses for an economic theory. My wish is that Americans wake up to their history. <br/><br/>The USA was deeply indebted to the USSR, who paid an enormous price to save the world from Hitler, and the minute FDR died, the oligarchs turned on Stalin just as FDR feared they would. American plutocrats hate democracy so much they allied themselves with Nazi monsters after the war to beggar the USSR. All the coups, all the killings, all that wars that ensued for decades, all the monstrous atrocities the USA perpetrated during the Cold War and kept secret from the American people, originated in the greedy minds of those whose political progeny are today's \"Republican elite.\" Monsters all. War criminals all. Enemies of the American working family all.",
