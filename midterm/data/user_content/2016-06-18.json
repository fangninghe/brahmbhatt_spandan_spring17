				"commentBody": "The \"con-artists from the left or right\" are an inevitable consequence of elective government in the absence of (genuine) Democracy.<br/><br/>Another economics Nobel laureate who specialised in this field (James Buchanan) described the problem of \"adverse selection\" of political agents in the following terms:<br/><br/>\u201c[S]uppose that a monopoly right is to be auctioned; whom will we predict to be the highest bidder? Surely we can presume that the person who intends to exploit the monopoly power most fully, the one for whom the expected profit is highest, will be among the highest bidders for the franchise. In the same way, positions of political power will tend to attract those persons who place higher values on the possession of such power. These persons will tend to be the highest bidders in the allocation of political offices. . . . Is there any presumption that political rent seeking will ultimately allocate offices to the \u2018best\u2019 persons? Is there not the overwhelming presumption that offices will be secured by those who value power most highly and who seek to use such power of discretion in the furtherance of their personal projects, be these moral or otherwise? Genuine public-interest motivations may exist and may even be widespread, but are these motivations sufficiently passionate to stimulate people to fight for political office, to compete with those whose passions include the desire to wield power over others?\u201d (James Buchanan and Geoffrey Brennan, \u201cThe Reason of Rules\u201d.)",

I conditionally support Trump for radically different reasons.<br/><br/>If you look at his stated positions as well as his related pronouncements over the years, other than immigration, they're quite moderate -- clearly, the man has a foot in each ideological camp. I believe he has the potential to pull our congressional ideological extremes, kicking and screaming, to the center, where deals can be made. And I believe he WILL force deals. I don't believe he cares a fig about parties and would seek to define solutions that he could sell to enough Americans to make them real.<br/><br/>God, we need that so desperately.<br/><br/>If you listen to Hillary, she's mouthing leftish platitudes as if she has the slightest chance of getting ANY of them enacted. She's the low-risk candidate, but also the low-return candidate, as well. I prefer the high-risk, high potential return alternative.<br/><br/>Now, of course, Trump may NOT adopt a measure of gravitas or offer a rational policy framework with some meat on it; and if he fails to do so, I can always turn right around and support Hillary as the best of two badly flawed choices, but as the one who would get us into less trouble.<br/><br/>You, on the other hand, are utterly enslaved to party, and will support whoever Democrats tell you to support, irrespective of her chances of actually making better lives for Americans.",

It might be Jacqueline Onassis giving to the Central Park Conservancy, or one of the Koch Brothers giving Lincoln Center enough money for a building, or the family of \"Sunny\" von Bulow donating enough to add a wing or a pavilion onto a hospital. Carl Icahn gave so much money that a medical school changed its name.<br/><br/>There is nothing comparable bearing Donald Trump's name or that of his father Fred. I mean, sure, the name is all over; but it adorns garish privately-owned office and residential towers -- sometimes built where beautiful buildings once stood. And we also have the song Woody Guthrie wrote about how much he hated his bigoted landlord, but I don't think that counts as a Fred Trump contribution.<br/><br/>After 9/11, there were numerous ways in which someone could help. For example, Stephen J. Gould and his wife created a foundation that provided equipment to the workers at The Pile. (A pair of boots might last only one day, so intense was the heat. Rubber soles melt.) Many top members of the NY Fire Department attended a memorial service for Dr. Gould, as did a departmental bagpipe squad. Others organized to fund and stage Christmas parties at firehouses (to which the families of deceased firefighters were invited). That continued through 2004 at the earliest. <br/><br/>Where's Trump's foundation? What did he do to help the helpers?",

May be the \"truth\" lies between tax cuts to unlock huge gobs cash stacked outside the system for private investment growth (i.e. job growth) and some solace (not a carrot) to the middle class as well. A judicious thinking is somehow not manifested in the article.",

Saudi is the direct or indirect source of all terror acts throughout the world and they fund the spreading of hate and fear thru the madrassas and mosques. They are not our ally, rather an enemy. Our powers close their eyes because  of the financial influence of the Saudi regime.Bush should have gone after them post  9/11 to eliminate the root cause of terrorism throughout the world.",

							"commentBody": "As usual, we claim to support democracy, but one of our \"cornerstones\" in Mideast policy is the Saudi royal family, which lives in opulence,  and has close business ties to the Bush family, while most Saudis live in poverty? They behead more people than ISIS, among other brutal punishments, for anything from insulting the Princes to being gay. They are well known to fund extremist Muslims all over the world.<br/>Why do we support such a regime? Why do we care what they say about our foreign policy? Because powerful people in our government and the corporations that finance their campaigns get rich off of their oil.<br/>Almost all of the hijackers were Saudis, but we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, where global corporations now control their oil (not the US).<br/>Why do we think it is good to go around the world supporting violent regimes that suppress their own people to get cheap resources from them? Why are we surprised when people who we help suppress with our overt and covert power come to attack us. How can we pretend we didn't directly create ISIS by invading Iraq?<br/>Hypocrisy kills. As long as we project military power around the world, making the world safe for global capital, people will be coming here trying to kill us. I'm surprised there aren't a lot more of them.<br/>Canada doesn't have a terror problem. Lets take control of our foreign policy back from stateless billionaires that use the media to manipulate us into doing the wrong thing all over the world. ",

It should not always be assumed by Europe or our own State Dept. that we have a responsibility to intervene in every crisis. Our biggest threat is ISIS and the Administration is slowly and methodically beating them back. NATO (mostly Europe) should have been, and should be currently, taking a more aggressive role in bringing peace to Syria. They have the most to gain form peace in the region.",
