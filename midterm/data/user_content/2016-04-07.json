				"commentBody": "I saw this very much in my own family, where my ridiculously favored sibling struggled and never figured out what he wanted to do in life, hates what he wound up doing and has been counting down his remaining years to retirement for some time now.  And because he was favored, he was expected to be a pleaser, and that affected him well into adulthood as well.  Being decidedly un-favored, but having a huge amount of pride, I grew up expecting to not be liked and found over time that it was immensely freeing.  People were happy to get basic cooperation from me whereas my favored sibling had the constant pressure of making my mother proud and happy.    The book you reference sounds fascinating-- I had never thought of the favoritism as a form of narcissism, but it absolutely was.    ",

The biggest deficit a team can have after the second batter is 2-0. The game is by no means over at 2-0, unless Koufax or Gibson are pitching. If you are that bored attending a ballgame just whip out your cell phone and text away. Better be sitting behind some screening, unless you want to take a shot off the old noggin from a boring baseball.",

The Super Bowl media blitz. <br/><br/>Baseball:  Nine innings, or more. Games run three hours plus, no time limit. Plenty of down time. No showtime, no sexy dancers, little physical contact and what there is, mostly prohibited and penalized. One hundred sixty two games plus a long post season of wild card games, intraleague playoffs and a seven game final 'World Series.'<br/><br/>In this age of short attention spans, twitter, you tube videos and cars that have become rolling wifi nodes and video infotainment centers, you wonder why baseball's fans average over 50 years of age?<br/><br/>Hint: it ain't because baseball is a racist, white man's game. The guys playing major league baseball are as diverse as they have ever been, with players from all over Latin America, Japan, Korea, anywhere the game is popular and well played, by young men (oh no, it's a sexist game as well!) of whatever color.<br/><br/>I've loved watching baseball since the 50s. Played it as a kid. I stood up and cheered and laughed uncontrollably when Bautista flipped his bat, because it was exactly the right thing to do at that point in that game; just as I loved Junior's style. Part of the fun was how much it rankled dour old Buck.<br/><br/>Oh, by the way, I'm an old Jewish white guy. What percentage of the players are Jewish? Is baseball 'unbearably anti-Semitic?'

				"commentBody": "Eliminating tenure will have three undesirable consequences<br/>1. Faculty will become the servants of administrators.  Most universities have substantial numbers of non-tenure track faculty  who understand their only responsibility is to cater to the whims of people who became administrators to make more money, because they didn't like teaching, and their research interests dried up.<br/>2. Highly competent faculty will abandon academia in droves, those incapable of leaving will stay behind.<br/>3. Competent faculty will cost substantially more. Scholars will give up income for security and stability, take away security and you will have to pay a risk premium for talented faculty, or hire the untalented.",
