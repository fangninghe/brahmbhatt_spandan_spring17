Like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, I believe that Citizens United was wrongly decided and has produced terrible results.  But to impose a litmus test on a Supreme Court nominee to overturn precedent is no different than the Republicans who will support only nominees who pledge to overturn Roe v. Wade.  Senator Sanders's response showed a disregard for judicial independence, and for President Obama's judgment.  More important, it underscored that he is candidate with a very limited focus, and a naive view of Congressional politics.  No wonder he has been unable to accomplish anything of substance in all his years in the Senate.  ",

They gave her over $11 million in speaking fees, not the $675,000 that you quote. I hate to break it to you, but those guys don't invest money without expecting a great deal in return.<br/><br/>The New York Times itself has stated in an editorial that she should release the transcripts about what she said in these speaking engagements; she knows she cannot do that and retain the possibility of being a viable candidate.<br/><br/>That's what the big deal is about Clinton's speaking fees. They mean that she is for sale, and she is being deceitful and duplicitous about it. Although you may not think that is unusual for a politician, that is something that many feel should change.<br/><br/>Oh, and by the way, Sanders was not an ineffective senator from Vermont, although this newspaper, and Clinton's supporters, would love you to believe that, and they have made quite an effort to actively denigrate his efforts and achievements.",

Clinton cites all the wonderful works she did as secretary of state.  It reminds me of the old Tom Lehrer song where he sang \"Let's make peace they we did in Stanleyville and Saigon.\"  If one were to listen to her you'd think she brought peace to the middle east.<br/>And I didn't hear one statement from her of how, with all her experience, she would bring peace there and defeat Isis.
