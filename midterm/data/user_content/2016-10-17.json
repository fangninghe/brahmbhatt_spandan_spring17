The Upper Big Branch mine disaster revealed that almost all dead miners had black lung disease and that air quality safeguards were deliberately bypassed by the company, while Federal Social Security picks up the disability tab.<br/><br/>Another, perhaps the largest contributor is the worker who is paid cash for work and avoids bank accounts in favor of prepaid  debit cards. They are motivated to avoid taxes, child support and alimony, all of which can be levied on bank accounts. Only 61% of child support payments are made, but many others pay the custodial parent in cash and kind. <br/><br/>When the Deepwater Horizon disaster trustees attempted to reimburse small businesses along the Gulf Coast for losses, very few actually had any recent tax returns to support their claims because they hadn't filed any. <br/><br/>It's past time to better understand how much of the male labor participation fall-off is really the explosion of the cash economy.",

That means one in five men in their prime at the office, the factory, the warehouse, at the construction site are are taking medications each day to relieve pain.  And I thought cigarettes were a pubic health problem!  <br/><br/>How on earth can something like this happen?  This means tens of millions of pills are being consumed each day for pain.  They must be coming from somewhere?  Are they coming from the drug cartels or are they coming from neighborhood drug stores?  Who is writing all of these prescriptions?<br/><br/>We have seen so many accusations, particularly from the right, that drug use is a moral failing.  With drug use of these proportions, that argument goes out the window.  These guys have jobs.  They aren't bouncing between the street and jail.  <br/><br/>A couple of years ago, I asked a contractor working in the neighborhood with a hispanic crew if he tried to hire white guys.  He said he really does try but most of them can't pass a drug test.  No kidding!  <br/><br/>Big pharma is now the pusher de jour.  Doctors are now the enablers.  The insurance companies are the financiers and the rest of us pay for it all with sky high premiums. <br/><br/>And we wonder why healthcare consumes 18% of GDP.  Man what a gravy train.  It all starts with that first bottle of pills.  And they still have pain.       ",

The article points out that it is also not very effective at relieving pain.  If you would watch Frontline on PBS, you would have learned that overuse of Oxycontin is fueling the heroin epidemic.  You would learn that there are pill mills where people line up to get prescriptions all day long for these drugs.  Many addicts start with a legitimate use like a sore joint or injury and then quickly get addicted.<br/><br/>Once again, you are making the conservative argument that moral failing causes drug addiction.  It does not.  I am not making a shameful slur against decent human beings.  You are speaking from ignorance stemming from a complete lacking of understanding how drug addiction starts and perpetuates itself.<br/><br/>Yes, these are good decent people who are also drug addicts.  They are your neighbors and co-workers.  Millions of them, everywhere.  Most of them are white.  They are dopers just like the people on the street.  They have jobs and function, but they are still dopers.<br/><br/>Just because you don't understand something, doesn't mean the something doesn't exist.  Good decent working people with prescriptions are drug addicts.  Millions of them.  And now, many are turning to heroin because its much cheaper.  Millions of them.",

				"commentBody": "The correlation between high levels of and long term unemployment and chronic painkiller usage is not surprising to me, but I think the problem starts with people being labeled addicts right off the bat, when 'pain management' is all the rage in the managed care industry. Our medical industry focuses more on treating symptoms than on the curing or remission of medical and mental health conditions. I work in disability law. Insurance companies are fine approving medications, but more expensive treatments or surgery that could provide long term improvements are frequently denied. To make matters worse when people lose their jobs, they often lose insurance coverage and in some states an individual can only quality for medicaid if they have been found disabled. And there is a lot medicaid does not cover. SS does not like to find men or women who are under retirement age disabled, esp under the age of 50. <br/><br/>But we have a huge problem in our country. Many men bet the ages of say 35 and 50 who have only done low or unskilled manual labor their entire working lives who can no longer physically perform this work and cannot easily be retrained for higher skilled, sedentary work. There are also too many men and women being forced out of higher skilled jobs starting in their 40's because of age and wage discrimination. Employers can get 2 recent grads for the price of one senior employees salary.  ",

							"commentBody": "Very good analysis of the societal mechanics of the legal, pharmaceutical, and the relationship between type of work environments and physical disabilities. As you've pointed out, the complexity of getting just one person straightened out in the sense of treatments for the physical, emotional, and mental issues in combination with the legal (compensation or other issues) ageisim limits and discrimination, plus whatever re-training is possible is maddening and there will be many ground into non functioning workers. I've spent decades on the Psychotherapy end of the re-assembly line which for me was both highly rewarding (no not money) and maidenly suffocating. Disability and workman's compensation cases drag on for years. The criminal justice system has its own ghastly role in many instances. But these don't even take the individual's family and social life into account. Just suffer until they give up is the outcome de jour. Those that come through in a healthy sense of wholeness are in the vast minority. These news cycled reports that alarm and sensationalize \"Opioid Users\" need to go back to real reporting instead of the trivialized versions that pop out on slow news days. Thanks for being involved in the effort to render real assistance to the many suffering people who are just floundering in the shallows.",

It doesn't mean that individual people in the United States were not generous and did not welcome her.  The United States as a governing entity took six years to grant her citizenship and that's pretty typical.

Even spouses and the military kids did this.  This was considered a sign of respect for the American flag representing their fellow countrymen.   When my brother was killed in Vietnam, Army soldiers presented his coffin at the airport to his wife and my Dad, a former WWII Navy pilot.  His coffin was neatly draped with the U.S. flag.  Out of honor for my brother, the Army soldiers were very respectful of his coffin and the flag covering it.  Since that time, I have had conversations with his fellow pilot and friend who brought his body back to Wisconsin.  I asked him if he and my brother ever talked about the causes, affects, and deeper meanings of war, and more specifically, the Vietnam War.  He told me that my brother was a wonderful guy and trusted friend, and that if Tom would have survived Vietnam as he did, my brother would have been the President of the Vietnam Veteran\u2019s against the war.  My brother died for his country, but he respected others\u2019 lives and struggles, even \"enemy\" soldiers.  I believe my brother today would fight for and respect the right of his fellow Americans to protest injustices in a respectful manner.  (Thomas F.

Management says you are no longer worth the contract, so renegotiate or you won't be playing the game for us.  He could choose to take his accumulated millions and his brain and go get another job (or never work again) - or he can choose to have a contract that both can live with and use it to audition for a trade.<br/>You need to understand a little more about what slavery is.

				"commentBody": "Colin Kaepernick should not be anywhere near the field. I'm surprised he even has a job. If you take knee for the pledge, then you are disrespecting our country. If you want to protest, don't do it on the football field. None of this situation would of happened if Colin just took his opinion somewhere else. Many people protest black rights just like him. The only difference is he does it where he shouldn't. People come to watch football not see you petty protest.",

(And about a hundred grand for every pass he completed in today's 45-16 loss to the Bills?)  Sorry, ain't buyin' it.  ",
