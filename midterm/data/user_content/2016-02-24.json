If that is so, how is it that Apple is supposed to solve the FBI's problem?  I don't really object to them opening a device of a dead person or even of a live person provided that person has been given notice and a meaningful opportunity to argue that the phone should not be opened up. I do, however, see many reasons why law abiding individuals have good reasons to prevent both open and surreptitious inspection of their information.",

				"commentBody": "The Bureau seems to want Apple to disable the ten-tries-and-you're-erased feature of its operating system.  That would enable them to \"brute force\" a password - to keep guessing the password until they guess right.  That requires a very simple piece of code that endlessly repeats; the only variable is how fast your computer cycles.  NSA's hot rods could do it in a second or two - China, Russia, Japan, Israel, most of the EU and a few other countries could do the same.  Big corporations could do it a bit slower, as could Al Quaeda or ISIS.  The bratty nerd next door could, though he might have to tie up his laptop for a few days.  With WiFi and 4G, it could be done remotely, though that would take a little higher-level coding skills.  As far as the disable code itself, I'm surprised it isn't already floating around the Darkweb - you just need familiarity with the programming language and access to a sophisticated enough decompiler to know where to insert the code.<br/><br/>What the government is asking for, then, is not a front or back door, or a way to hack into the operating system.  They would simply open up the whole shebang and hang up an \"Enter Here\" sign on every device with Apple software.  And don't think those few lines of disable code will remain secret for long.  The days when software was written by one or two unwashed misfits are long gone - it's done by committee with multiple layers of approvals, and it will leak.<br/><br/>Reason No. 1001 why we don't trust government.",

Hogwash.  They spout higher purposes as a hook to get better ROI.<br/><br/>If Apple wanted to be a good corporate citizen not maniacally devoted to ROI, it wouldn't be paying slave wages to Chinese laborers while charging a small fortune in the US for phones they say are innovative by...having increased the screen size.  <br/><br/>Apple may have jumped the shark here.  It isn't bigger than the US government.  It may have legitimate, ROI tinctured reasons for refusing to unlock the phone.  But moral reasons?  Give me a break.  <br/><br/>Steve Jobs was the most cynical manipulator of craven human attributes the world has ever seen.  Tim Cook is following along lockstep.  <br/><br/>The truly higher moral ground would be to help the FBI unlock this particular phone and not try to stand on principles that Apple doesn't have and never had.  Instead, it is, as usual, touting moral principles for one purpose and one purpose only--maximizing ROI.  Milton Friedman would be proud.",

				"commentBody": "Do you have any evidence that illegal aliens use more tax dollars than say, Wal-mart employees?  All the government services you mention (except food and housing, which frankly I don't believe are given except perhaps as free school lunches and access to low income housing projects ) are also open to every low income resident.  My impression is that illegal aliens actually use far fewer government services per capita than citizens; however, it may be  a larger fraction of their total income because they tend to be low income.

When the government forces Apple to break encryption protocols and create backdoors, we all become less secure from attacks. Maybe the FBI will only use this on criminals' phones, but Chinese and Russian hackers will have no such qualms. ",
