				"commentBody": "Moral capital cannot exist without respect for the truth.  Without respect for the truth, we cannot respect each other because none of us then stand for anything.  Life becomes a continuous con job.  It becomes a do whatever you can get away with exercise.<br/><br/>Unrestrained capitalism has no respect for the truth.  Unrestrained libertarianism doesn't need the truth.  Trump and his followers don't need the truth.<br/><br/>A difference of opinion is one thing, like preferring nuclear power over solar, or local public schools over charter schools.  But when entire political movements trash all semblance of the truth to acquire power, the whole business of governance grinds to a halt.  That's where we are in America today.  That's why Trump has risen to such a height.<br/><br/>Right wing media began because some thought that their views were not being aired.  Once they corrected that problem, they kept going and lost their grip on reality.  The quest for power and money took over.  They lost respect for the truth.  In doing so, they bankrupted their moral capital and gave us Trump.<br/><br/>Moral capital involves the consideration of people lives, the quality of their experiences and their basic needs.  The quest for profits only cares about its own perpetuation and not about where it goes and how they are used. <br/><br/>The repairs to moral capital need to be concentrated on the right side of the isle.  We bleeding hearts have always had more moral capital than profits.",

Even as clueless as he is, which is intergalactic, he knows he could never handle the demands of the office. All he's ever wanted to do is to RUN for office. To him, the election is a game. Or, more correctly, just an extension of his trash game show mentality.
