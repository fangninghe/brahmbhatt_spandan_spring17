Later he argues there is \"no evidence that dividend schemes would elicit much public support.\" and \"What little polling evidence exists seems to point to the opposite direction.\" However, polling data are notoriously fickle, particularly when no one has experience with it. Support would likely shift dramatically, once people started receiving checks.",

It works the same the other way.<br/><br/>Of course we should support those inside attempting to do what we agree is right. It is difficult to \"support\" without crossing that line. Remember, that means we offend even those we think we are helping, as this author points out.<br/><br/>Also, the women we seek to help are themselves inside that culture, and they love their sons and husbands and many of their fathers. We won't get far with most women telling them that they love evil men, their own baby is evil.<br/><br/>We also won't get far telling them they are weak or inferior until they are more like us, more like the alien Other. That would not work here even if it was true, and it won't work there either.<br/><br/>Some of their cultural preferences which are not the same as ours really are their preferences. They get to have their own preferences. If we seek to deny that, they will not see us as helping them, nor want to be helped.<br/><br/>Given all that, this is actually very difficult. It does not get easier when we are so sure we are completely right, completely superior, and our (rather recent) ideas are the only possible ideas for others.",

				"commentBody": "excluding the major cancer inducing factor of inhaling foreign matter into the precious lungs is perhaps the best medicine for this life threatening habit.  we inhale any number of known/unknown chemicals on a daily basis just driving behind endless streams of vehicles, working on factories, sniffing deodorant laden bodies and wafting completely non-metric components of a billion years of natural emissions.  burning tobacco and sucking it directly in to get some profit share up for these tobacco growers is insane.  CalTech boffo's can surmise what they want, but the time to mitigate the death rate is NOW!",

							"commentBody": "Then maybe you need to back the heck off and get out of the vapers PERSONAL space!  Vape or no vape, crowding into my personal space might just get you a poke in the mouth or shoved across the floor  into the nearest wall.  Vape plumes, even large ones,  only cover a few cubic feet, and dissipate within seconds.  Claiming the scent is harming you is like claiming you gained weight from smelling a chocolate cake baking in an oven 12 feet away.. it ain't going to happen.  If you are so concerned with additives.. maybe you need to go on an additive free diet.  No food color, no added flavorings, no preservatives, no cake, no cookies, no chocolate, no TIC TACS!  No nothing.. just a strict diet of water... Oh wait.. they add fluorine and bleach to water, don't they.  Maybe you should just stay inside your home and avoid all those nasty things completely.  OH and don't worry, an average human will die from dehydration in less than 7 days.  So your worries about \"additives\" will be at an end.<br/><br/>I apologize to the other forum readers, but people that post to forums with out a clue what they are talking about is just plain annoying.  It is obvious this person did no research at all about the contents of vape fluid.  Granted, some juice does contain bad ingredients, but as far as I know, vapers avoid those, which in effect will force self regulation among the producers.  ",

				"commentBody": "You can count me in as an e-cigarette success story.  I smoked for over 30 years, and had family nag me for almost the same amount of time to quit.  I had tried quitting cold turkey, using patches, using gum, using Chantix.  I could never quit for more than 26-36 hours before the cravings got so bad that I went back to smoking.  Back around 2009, I had tried e-cigs and hated it.  It really wasn't like smoking and inhaling through a chunk of saturated material was just too hard.  Since then, the technology advanced by leaps and bounds.  In just a few short years, vaporizer technology went from the equivalent of the Model T to a modern car with a biturbo engine with climate control, navigation, cruise control and collision avoidance.  I decided to give vaping another try.  On January 6, 2015 I smoked my last cigarette and started vaping.  For the first few weeks, I vaped a lot.  Every time I felt the craving for a cigarette, I picked up my vaporizer.  It will be 14 months next week since I started vaping and I have not had a single cigarette in all that time.  Every once in a while I will still think about cigarettes, but then my vaporizer is there and after a few puffs the thought goes away.  One clue that I am winning the battle with smoking is that now I can go much longer without vaping than I could without smoking.  In the past I couldn't go longer than a couple of hours between cigarettes before I started getting the jitters.",
