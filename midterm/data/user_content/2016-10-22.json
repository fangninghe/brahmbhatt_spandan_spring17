The solution? Release nothing that isn\u2019t pried from her cold, living hands \u2013 and then make sure it\u2019s been sanitized.<br/><br/>This isn\u2019t rocket science, guys. And she isn\u2019t fooling anyone. Her core supporters want her elected REGARDLESS of what\u2019s discovered in leaks. But if more IS revealed and it represents serious abuse of national secrets or other illegal activities, particularly with her foundation, those who are riding the fence but leaning to her could just abandon her, giving Trump a win.<br/><br/>But WikiLeaks does not offer a lesson for Sec. Clinton: she never had a choice about coming clean because she might be indicted if she did. She just had to take a chance on WikiLeaks \u2013 maybe it destroys her, maybe it doesn\u2019t, because hackers either decide not to release what they have for their own reasons, or because they don\u2019t have anything more.",

Actually most states have state militias under a variety of names but all serve the same purpose - protect and defend the state from all enemies foreign and domestic. <br/><br/>If you want to keep and bear arms that should mean that you automatically become an associate member of the state militia and have mandatory screening, training, qualification and inspection of your private arsenal as well as being subject to the laws and discipline of the state militia. Use a weapon and you are subject to courts-martial and punishment.  Also association will demonstrate who is, and isn't, qualified for certain types of weapons. <br/><br/>While the SCOTUS decision asserted the individual rights, it did not say that the states cannot require service in the state militia as part of their duties as defined in the Second Amendment.

We have succumbed to a gun lobby that has successfully skewed the intended meaning of the 2nd amendment to take on a persona and meaning WAY beyond common sense and the times. Yes, owning a gun is a RIGHT, but like ALL of our constitutional rights, there is no stipulation as to how those rights are guaranteed. We simply will never stop the senseless violence and butchery with the status quo and current tendency. More kids will die, more cops will die, more innocents will die. As a society, we are simply in perpetual denial of reason or logic and we are flat lying to ourselves that we can actually do something about it while continuing to enable and foment the problem. I don't know about you, \"we the people\", but I am tired and burnt out on the stupidity of the conversation which leads us nowhere. Change the conversation and we will change the outcome. ",

Virginia was determined to get it back.  The 2nd was written in Virginia, not Philadelphia, by a Virginian, for the primary benefit of Virginians.   The personal ownership of firearms was not even brought up for discussion at the meeting in Richmond where the 2nd was composed.<br/><br/>That \"intended purpose\" went away in 1865 when slavery was finally eliminated.",

				"commentBody": "Occasionally a public figure shows the rest of the public, just what the south end of a northbound horse is like. Trump shows even under the most genteel circumstances, he is unable to control his rancor, his lack of propriety is there for ll to see. What he thinks of funny, is considered rude and insulting by people with manners and upbringing.<br/><br/>Oh, Hilary is not a comedian, yes she is serious and cerebral, and has been the target of smears and vitriol for many years, it probably precludes her making fun of herself, she probably fears some Trumpian will use it to denigrate her, as have the conservative cabal. Let us hope she will loosen up a bit one she is the Pres.<br/><br/>Trump has made a habit of ingratiating himself with those in power. Most of them have realized they have been used just to further his ambitions, and not because he actually likes them. He made himself persona non grata even among those who might still have some positive feelings about him. Getting booed at the Al Smith dinner is the ultimate insult, you can't get much lower.<br/><br/>It is not his political life he is fighting for, it is his economic life. He can not get any more financing from American banks, even the evil Carl Icahn wont lend to him. He has a fraud trial pending along with a RICO charge, then we will see what his source of income is. <br/><br/>A goth would make a better dinner companion than Trump. He was invited due to protocol, it won't happen again.",

The CDC totaled a count of 33,000 deaths by guns. 23,000 were suicides, and remember that Japan does not allow citizens to own guns yet their suicide rate is almost double the U.S.. So now we are at 10,000 deaths by guns, of which gang bangers that get their guns off the street account for 5,000 deaths, so now we are at 5,000 deaths, and 3,000 are from police shootings and the other 2,000 are actual premeditated killings and someone going nutso and shooting people. So where are these big numbers you are talking about? 36,000 people died in car accidents last year. Over 400,000 die from a medical malfunction, why do we not get rid of doctors? Your logic defies reason. Please answer me.",
