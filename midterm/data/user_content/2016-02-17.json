This President has gone around Congress repeatedly to try to change laws that he could not get past Congress. Now Congress is biting back. I was not a fan of Scalia and would prefer to see more judges like Kennedy and fewer like Scalia, Thomas, Ginsburg and Breyer (whose votes can be predicted in advance). But, if RBG had died in the last year of Bush's second term, there is no way that Democrats would have let Bush appoint her successor. Everyone knows that. The outrage is -- as always -- selective. And let's remember that the Supreme Court nominating process was politicized first by Democrats in the 1980s. They started this nonsense with Bork. And they won the battle. But they lost the war because now all nominations are decided on mostly partly-line votes. Democrats let the genie out of the bottle with Bork and there's no going back.",

The same will happen if Obama courses to far left.  It is what is SUPPOSED to happen per our constitution. <br/><br/>But to say the Democrats let the genie out of the bottle, or would have done the same to W is off point for the former and impossible to prove for the latter. The concern many of us have is that there are too many people who are making up some absurd case, which is what the Republicans are prone to do politically speaking.  Then complete anti-constitutional nonsense like saying Obama can't nominate a judge is repeated over and over by fools. Geico should do a commercial where they say \"if you're a Republican, this is just what you do\".  This has become the Republican way, and sadly it is why even those of us who lean slightly to the right on many issues cannot support the party.<br/><br/>The truth is the Founders created laws that beg for compromise. We have a President on one end and a Senate on the other. The judge, as far as I see it, should be end up in the middle. And you know what? A judge that actually has to think about the law from the middle is what most of us want anyway.  Scalia, as much as he was a whatever you call him, simply tortured logic in the way he went about Heller. He was a partisan and it's time to stop nominating partisans on either side.",

Let's face it: Hillary would run up the deficit even worse than Bernie, since she would have at least an outside chance of actually passing legislation; Bernie would do nothing but give angry speeches \u2013 which at least wouldn't raise the national debt.<br/><br/>Paying down debt isn't glamorous, which is precisely why that part of Keynesian economics has never been as widely embraced as the \"prime the pump\" part. But a lot of Americans think we need to do that. National debt has nearly doubled since Obama took office -- not his fault, really, since the debt has been jumping ever since Reagan took office. The fact remains: national debt has doubled since Obama took office, and I don't think voters will pick a candidate who's likely to either (1) accomplish nothing at all (Bernie); or (2) run up the debt at an even higher pace (Hillary). I think voters are going to do what they nearly always do after one party has held the White House for two terms: toss that party out and let the other one have a crack at it.",

				"commentBody": "Given the six major cases on the Supreme-Court\u2019s pipeline, a Senate gridlock to filibuster a candidacy the Republicans don\u2019t like would be of grave concern. The reason: a 4-to-4 vote split in most cases would result in justice delayed, and likely in justice denied. <br/><br/>This is the time for President Obama to prevent another bitter partisan war by extending an olive branch to Senator Charles Grassley and moderate Republicans. <br/><br/>I am confident Judge Jane Kelly would be the perfect candidate.  She was confirmed 96 to 0 in her appointment to the Appeals Court with the unwavering support of no other than Senator Grassley who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee.<br/><br/>For President Obama, Plan B would be Judge Adalberto Jordan who was confirmed to the Appeals Court by 94 votes to 5 with the support of 41 Republicans. <br/><br/>Both candidates would give President Obama an opportunity to strike common grounds by helping the GOP senators to demonstrate some courage and save face. Those who wish to maintain partisanship over patriotism would be in a Catch-22 situation, considering the high GOP-vote score achieved by each candidate in the latest confirmation.<br/><br/>I just wish the narrative of the debate was focused more on innovative options for mutual gains.",
