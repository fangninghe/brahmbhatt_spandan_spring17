Well I hereby accuse you of inordinate attraction to a fun rhyme. Since when, by the way, was the point of sport--any sport--anything BUT fun? Sure, I can well imagine someone claiming it serves this other purpose or that other purpose, but I can't imagine that someone not being completely full of it. Exercise? Discipline? Etc. (blah, blah, blah)? You don't need to race to get exercise (etc.: blah, blah, blah). The competition is precisely what makes it a game, and games are always and only for fun. <br/><br/>Re: \"funded by the public's money\"<br/><br/>The public funds it because the public finds it fun to have it. It's fun to watch and root; it's fun to have the entire celebration. It produces absolutely NOTHING.",

In reality, these areas ARE floodplains, they are just considered (by FEMA and local development regulatory overseers) as being flooded just infrequently enough that they do not require flood insurance. The fallacy that the lack of NFIP requirement must mean that a home is not in a floodplain is a disastrous falsehood to fall prey to. This is a widespread belief that must be debunked.... the one silver lining of these (once?) rare floods is to shed light on this mis-education. To think that folks here in soggy and flat LA, of all places, have this mindset really goes to show you how large of a hurdle this will be to overcome. <br/><br/>I, for one, think that one day of gutting a flooded house is more than enough...not looking to have to repeat this shutting soon.<br/><br/>I am hopeful for a speedy recovery for your loved ones and mine.

				"commentBody": "\"Sustainable energy without the hot air\" by the Cambridge physicist and UK dept. of Climate Change director, David Mackay is the clearest guide to action. He was a lifelong teacher who didnt want to give people the<br/>\"answers\", but the tools to think for themselves and analyse a situation. Please do read his great book freely available online. And use his physics-informed analysis to retool your lifestyle and make the most effective choices to reduce your personal energy consumption. Americans after all consume 2X more energy per capita than Germany and other OECD countries:<br/>1. Reduce your flying. In a single transatlantic flight you consume as much energy as leaving a typical AC switched on for an entire year. See <a href=\"https://www.withouthotair.com/c5/page_35.shtml\" title=\"https://www.withouthotair.com/c5/page_35.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.withouthotair.com/c5/page_35.shtml</a><br/>2. Reduce/increase your thermostat in the summer/winter. The typical home's energy consumption drops by 10% for each 1 degC change in thermostat. Insulate your homes.<br/>3. Eliminate food waste. Food wasted is multiplied energy and water waste.<br/><br/>Lastly, dont be distracted by the myth that \"every little helps\". Seek out effective solutions to reduce energy consumption. As David often said \"If everyone does a little, we'll achieve only a little\"",

The flood plains that people use to avoid, they have now been developed,  Dams and levees created these areas and their development has not been a good idea.  These areas will be the first to go, with dire consequences, when the levees break.  <br/><br/>We think we can control this mighty river.  It is only a matter of time before the same type of torrential rains that, say 100 years ago, would have caused \"flooding\" here and there, but nothing out of the ordinary for those familiar with it, will wreak havoc in ways in which people are not familiar and for which they are woefully unprepared.  We used to know not to build on the flood plain of great rivers and next to the ocean.  We now think we can get away with it.  But we can't.  Flood plain development means \"where will we release the water, from what gate / dam / levee will the pressure be relieved.\"  And you better hope you're not in the way of that release.  ",

				"commentBody": "I was raised in both the Midwest and west.  We moved to Northern California when I was in middle school and it was instantly recognizable to me that people cared much less about money and material things than they did in the Midwest.  Many very wealthy families lived in small houses and drove old cars. Friend groups were very diverse in both ethnicity and socioeconomic status. People were welcomed and accepted immediately.  After returning to the Midwest (but a different town) it took a couple of years to break into a social group and people were aware of other people's houses,cars etc.  Social competition was high. <br/><br/>I now live again in Northern California, and thankfully  don't have this madness occurring in our elementary school.  Thus, I am  wondering if some of this might be more of a regional phenomenon?",
