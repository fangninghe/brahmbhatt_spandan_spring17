				"commentBody": "Donald Seekins -- \"half-baked imperialist adventures abroad (one of which Ms. Clinton heartily supported in 2003)\"<br/><br/>True, and more. She actually herself did three more herself.<br/><br/>Libya was her project, \"We came, we saw, he died.\" Th NYT explained in great detail how she was the one who did that, the \"hawk\" who pushed it through the Administration and our allies.<br/><br/>Syria's regime change started on her watch, run in country by the Ambassador she appointed who reported to her. It certainly got a lot worse after she left, but not only did she start it, she has consistently called to make it worse, with a no-fly zone and an occupied insurgent (\"refugee\") sanctuary inside Syria guarded by the forces of the US and NATO.<br/><br/>Ukraine, whatever one calls that project, was also hers. It was done while she was Sec of State, run by her own special assistant Sec Victoria Nuland, a buddy of Hillary appointed by Hillary and reporting to Hillary. Important assistance was by the Ambassador she also appointed, who also reported to her. The $5 billion used to do it per Nuland's brag was funneled through the State Dept run by Hillary.<br/><br/>She can't both brag of the important position she held, and claim that she in that position was not responsible for what was done in her name.<br/><br/>This is not just a matter of blame. She voted for it once, then did it three times, and urged each of them and Afghanistan too to be done bigger. We must expect as President she'd do what she has done so many times. ",
