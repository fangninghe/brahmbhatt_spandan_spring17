Or simply outbidding the world for a Jason Giambi or Mike Mussina.<br/><br/>Once the playing field for GM's was somewhat leveled?  Well, we've all seen Brian Cashman's true baseball acumen on full display over the last decade - billions spent,  wasted draft picks, moronic trades, even dumber non-trades and just one purchased World Series to show for it.  And who can forget the shameless retiring of Yankee numbers - posada?  Really????<br/><br/>Cashman is a disgrace who should've been fired a decade ago.",

They talked needing a good farm system for years. Over priced broken down free agents and poor trades is on the GM. Cashman has been on the job way to long and sadly current ownership does not have the nerve to find new leadership. The rebuild will take considerable time with no promises as more often than not young talent doesn't reach full potential. Maybe the empty seats and sinking revenue will create real change... new front office management. ",

In fact, if every single, or even more than 50% of the Republican Party read this carefully, they would revolt and ask Trump to step down.  Unfortunately, this editorial is written for the readers of the New York Times.  How many members of the \"stupid party\" read the New York Times?  What percentage of the \"stupid party\" are just like Trump in terms of their interest and ability in reading.  Significant.  So, I ask the author and the New York Times, just how to do you plan to distribute this truly accurate and important essay amongst the \"stupid party\" and more of the members of the \"smart party.\"  This is excellent writing and sentiment, but are you just going to write it for all the intellectually superior readers of your excellent newspaper?  Are you just going to be satisfied with preaching to the choir or are you doing to do something about it?  Inquiring minds would like to know.",

While it's intellectually satisfying to highlight the intellectual void of the current Republican party created by their nurture of ignorance and identity politics in their party's membership, the piece does nothing to advance the prospects of Clinton for President.  <br/><br/>So I'm left wondering if the NY Times, the paper of intellectuals who, having done so much advocacy journalism to advance the candidate of \"Clinton Democrat Dynasty Inc, LLC\", who is demonstrably more unelectable than Sanders would have been, has any pragmatic ideas about how to get those disenfranchised, angry, sinking white middle class voters to vote for the Lady in the White Pantsuit?  Calling them names isn't likely to work.  <br/><br/>Hey Mr. Rosenthal, as indeed we now see with the revelations of DNC emails that internal to the DNC was the free ideation on how (a supposedly neutral arbiter) could work to defeat Sanders, it's now brass tacks time.  What's your plan to get Clinton elected?  Come on into the gooey tar pit where we now have to figure out how to get the corporate candidate with the support of the population of middle America white-hot with rage against corporate America.  You helped put is in this tar pit, so what's the plan now?  For starters, let's take rigging the national election off the table.",

Ryan, who devised an impressive new budget plan for his party.\" You may want to revise that after reading the comments of economist NYTimes' Paul Krugman who said: <br/><br/>\"Look, Ryan hasn\u2019t \u2018crunched the numbers\u2019; he has just scribbled some stuff down, without checking at all to see if it makes sense. He asserts that he can cut taxes without net loss of revenue by closing unspecified loopholes; he asserts that he can cut discretionary spending to levels not seen since Calvin Coolidge, without saying how; he asserts that he can convert Medicare to a voucher system, with much lower spending than now projected, without even a hint of how this is supposed to work.\" Plenty more available. Ryan is a phoney.",

He noticed a crossword with the word UTAH (code word for one of the beaches at Normandy) and later noticed another crossword with OMAHA, another code named Normandy beach where the invasion was to occur. Finally, he noticed the word OVERLORD and concluded these were no coincidences but maybe a way of signaling the Germans of the planned invasion. British Intelligence interviewed the professor responsible for the crossword puzzles. He taught at a school where much of the staging for the invasion was located. The professor denied any knowledge or being a German spy. It turned out that he had given grids to his students and asked them to create crossword puzzles. Later it was learned that the young student who created the crossword puzzles had heard these three words and decided to include them, not knowing their significance. So, when the invasion occurred, the Allies weren\u2019t sure if the secrecy of the operation had been compromised. It wasn\u2019t and the Germans were caught by surprise.",

A happily married person (of either gender) is much less likely than an unhappily married person to have an affair.  Dispelling the mistress will not solve any of this.  And, contrary to what most of the comments here say, the existence (dispelled or not) of a mistress does not mean the problem is \"the philandering husband\"--it means there are serious underlying problems in the marriage that both partners need to face, and to which both partners probably contributed, if they want the marriage to be satisfying.    It's interesting that the article totally ignores this.",
