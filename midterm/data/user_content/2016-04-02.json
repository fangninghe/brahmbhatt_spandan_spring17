				"commentBody": "Comparisons between urban concentrations are notoriously difficult and often flawed.  In Massachusetts, for example, the central city is obviously Boston.  When the Census Bureau then defines of the Boston Metropolitan Area, they are able to make quite precise calculations as to how far the Boston area extents outward because the real political jurisdictions in Massachusetts are town and cities, not counties, as is the rule outside New England.  So the Boston metro area is made up of the central city any and all cities , e.g. the city of Somerville, and towns, e.g. the town of Lexington, that are economically and socially integrated with Boston.  Elsewhere in America, the task is much more difficult. For example, a city such as Cleveland is an urban center of the metropolitan area inside the next political jurisdiction, which is Cuyahoga County and which includes residential areas which are clearly rural.  So it's apples and oranges. As in Lexington, MA versus North Randall, OH, both in metropolitan areas.  ",

Half a dozen of my friends over 50 never got a permanent job again, after losing jobs in the last seven years, as well as some in their 40's and 30's.  The unemployment rate is just the number of people collecting unemployment checks, folks.  So those of us who lost careers in this mess fell off the charts long ago.  Coders have their pick of jobs, but work next to middle aged contractors, some of whom are living thousands of miles from family for temp work.

							"commentBody": "Ms. DiTomaso: Do you know who is pulling the strings for the whole superdelegate control of the Democratic Party? The Clintons. Do you know who is Chief of the Clinton Machine, aka the DNC? Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Did you hear Debbie Wasserman Schultz about a week ago give a talk in which she trashed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (championed by Elizabeth Warren) and give ringing endorsement to \"payday lenders\", the predatory lending operators who primarily prey upon the poor and the working poor with outrageous usury! Then Obama turned around and made public endorsement for the re-election of Debbie Wasserman Schultzas DNC leader.  Does any of that sound anything like a real Democratic Party set of values? It does sound like the Clinton Cult of Personality and the Clinton Machine in full operation. And you know what? It reeks of insider trading of favors and advantages and wealth and power. Some of us are sick of it. I hope to God Bernie is telling the truth and not spouting slogans like the \"hope and change\" guy turned out to be doing. Lots of us, old and young, think he is and we want to give him a chance to make change and we want to work for that to happen. We are already working with him to make the \"Democratic\" Party seem a little more - oh, you know - democratic!  The Superdelegate system of the DNC and the Clintonites is as corrupt as it gets. ",

							"commentBody": "Basically someone previously one as a Democrat in one race or another doesn't mean they should have a right to have a significant influence on the Democratic process. It should be One Man One Vote not having an arbitrary 15% cushion for party elites. Voters in those general elections weren't told they were voting for Democrat party super-delegates and moreover not all of them are general election candidate winners- some of them are elder statesmen or distinguished members of the party that could have been elected for office 20 or more years ago e.g. Jimmy Carter still has a superdelegate slot.<br/><br/>It is undermocratic and there is no spin you can put on it. Candidates should win on pledged delegates alone not superdelegates and there is no justification of general election or not. In fact there are superdelegates who are just party bosses or senior members but never ran for general election office for any Congress or Senate seat or Governorship etc. Superdelegates are arbitrary and any one knowledgeable of their creation knows they were put in 80's to end the 'unelectable' ultra-progressive liberals like McGovern, Carter or Mondale from being selected and Democrats then losing the general election. It was made to suppress 'grassroots activists' as Debbie Wasserman Schultz said recently. Plain and simple.",

But in the old days, we did not think of it as a murder. We just said abortion was illegal, immoral, against God. <br/><br/>Now these guys are saying it isn't illegal for religious or moral reasons.

What I don't see anyone saying is that, far from keeping their desire to punish women seeking abortions a secret, the pro-fetus crowd has several times used the power of the state to prosecute women who (having few other options in these states) self-induced. I believe at least one of these cases in recent years (involving a socially-isolated immigrant woman who bought an online herbal preparation meant to induce abortion), was in Indiana. There has been at least one related case involving a pregnant woman with active problems with substance abuse whose state tried to prosecute her for \"child abuse,\" endangerment, or something similar for her addiction, rather that getting her help. <br/><br/>Recall that the rash of proposed state legislation at the last election cycle that would have legally defined life as beginning at conception had similar provisions. Admittedly these referenda did not prove popular with voters, but watching these events unfold over the past several years, it has never occurred to me that there was any real question (or even effort to deny) that the extreme Christian right absolutely believe that women seeking abortions should be punished.",

However, I consider myself a political scientist and I have worked extensively in government and also worked for an office holder. I wish more Sanders supporters lived in the real world, because their expectations are wholly unrealistic, sometimes close to delusional. I think most Sanders supporters would agree that the US government has become a captive of elite special interests. But, a 2015 poll found that 50% of the electorate stated that they would not vote for a socialist. My question for Bernie's supporters is, how will Bernie, if he gets elected, be able to completely change this dynamic, even with a Democratic Congress? Probably one third of Democrats are tied to moneyed interests and to regain the House there will certainly be a number of Blue Dogs added.  A revolution is not going to happen, and just wishing by his supporters isn't enough. Look at how difficult it has been for Obama to make even modest reforms.  Whether you like it or not, change has to come incrementally and over time. Millenials are very liberal, but most voters over 40 aren't. It will take patient and slow change over the next generation to prepare the ground for the changes Bernie is proposing. ",
